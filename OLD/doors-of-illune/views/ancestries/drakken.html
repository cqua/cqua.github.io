		<h1>DRAKKEN</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../../content/drakken.png" alt="Drakken">
		<p>
			Believed to be descended from the long-extinct dragons, drakken have recently broken away from the Empire, forging a kingdom deserving of the reverence afforded by their ancestry led by the iron iconoclast King Tzoren. This kingdom is built atop a wealth of iron- through which they are able to arm themselves and their allies with greater speed than the Empireâ€™s bronze.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Weight of the Scales</b> Drakken have a strict social echelon determined by a creature's scales. Salamanders and kobold are considered akin to mutts; their scales are muddied and patchy. Chromatic drakken are considered to be competent, but susceptible to immoral temptations. Mettalic drakken, also called the Wrought, are almost always nobility, seen as both rich in strength and wisdom. Gold drakken are exceptionally rare- to be born gold is taken to be a sign of divine right. A gold drakken has not been born in many centuries.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Kin of Drakes</b> Gruff, critical, and suspicious, drakken make few friends outside their own kind. They covet treasure but temper their greed with the certainty that their ancestors are always watching. Thus, drakken conduct themselves with honor to avoid bringing shame to their family. Pureblood drakken stand 6 to 8 feet tall and weight 200 to 600 pounds, while those with mottle scales have greater variance. The live  about 300 years.

			<b>Common Names:</b> Apostol, Catalan, Dorin, Eusebiu, Gavril, Iancu, Mihaela, Otila, Razvan, Rozalia, Silviu, Vali, Viorica
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Familiy Names:</b> Drakken are more likely than other ancestries to have a family name which goes back centuries, and are difficult for non-drakken to pronounce. Kobold and salamanders generally do not have these. Common Family Names: Astiliabor, Azuvidexus, Eligius, Havarl, Olthontor, Sardior, Suraphis, Tektherios, Ysgithyrwyn
