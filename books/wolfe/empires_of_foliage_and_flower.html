               <p>When the sun was still young and men fools who worshipped war, the wise ones of Urth took for themselves the names of humble plants to teach men wisdom. Sage there was, who gave his name to all the rest. And Acacia and Fennel; Basil, that was their anointed leader; Lichen and Eglantine, Orchis, and many more.</p>
            <p>The greatest was Thyme.</p>
            <p>Thyme's habit it was to walk westward over the world, ever westward and ever older, whitening his beard and waiting for no one; and if ever he turned east, the days and the years dropped from him. The rest are gone, but Thyme (thus it was said) will walk till the sun grows cold.</p>
            <p>On a certain day, when dawn cast Thyme's shadow a league before him, he met a child in the road playing such a game as even Thyme, who had seen all games, had never seen before. For a moment Thyme halted. "Little girl," he said, "what is it you play?" For she gathered up seeds of the sallow-flowered garden pea, and ordered them in rows and circles, making them roll with her fingers; and scattered them to the winds, then gathered them again.</p>
            <p>"Peace," she said.</p>
            <p>Thyme bent over her, smiling. "I see you play at pease," he said. "Tell me what this game is."</p>
            <p>"These are people," the child said. She held up her pease to show him, and Thyme nodded his agreement. "At first they're soldiers like ours," and she marshalled a column, with advance guard, rear guard, skirmishers, and out-riders. "And then they fight, and then they can come home."</p>
            <p>"And will they never go to war again? Or fight with their wives?" Thyme asked.</p>
            <p>"No," the child said, "No, never."</p>
            <p>"Come with me, little girl," Thyme told her, and took her by the hand.</p>
            <p>All that day they tramped the dusty road together, mounting high hills and descending into bear-haunted vales where many say Thyme never comes. They crossed the wide valley of the Lagous, Thyme carrying the child on his shoulder at the ford of Didugua. Sometimes they sang, sometimes they talked, sometimes they went silently, walking hand in hand.</p>
            <p>And as they walked on side by side, the child grew, so that she who toddled in the beginning skipped and romped at the end. Thyme taught her to turn cartwheels, something he himself does very well.</p>
            <p>That night they camped beside the road. He built a small fire to keep her warm, and told her tale after tale, for no one knows as many stories as Thyme. Green apples he picked for her, but they were red and ripe when they left his fingers.</p>
            <p>"Who are you, sir?" the child asked, for now that Thyme had stopped, the ten watches of the night twittered and flitted like bats in the bushes about them, and she was a little frightened.</p>
            <p>"You may call me Thyme," he told her, "and I am an eremite. That means I live with the Increate, and not with men. Do you have a mother, child?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," she said. "And my mother will be worried about me, because I'm gone."</p>
            <p>"No," Thyme said, and he shook his white head. "No, your mother will understand, because I left a prophecy with her when you were born. Do you know it? Think, because you must often have heard it."</p>
            <p>The child thought; and when the cricket had sung, she said, ""Thyme will take my child from me.' Yes, sir, Mama often used to say that."</p>
            <p>"And did she not say anything more?"</p>
            <p>The child nodded. "She said, And Thyme will surely bring her back."</p>
            <p>"You see, she will not worry, child. The Increate is father to all. I take them from him—that is my function. And I return them again."</p>
            <p>The child said, "I don't have a father, sir."</p>
            <p>Again Thyme shook his head. "You have the Increate and you have me. You may call me Father Thyme. Now go to sleep."</p>
            <p>The child slept, being still quite small. To make a small enchantment for her, Thyme moved his hands; gossamer covered her to keep her warm, and the flying seed of cottonwood and dandelion. She slept, but Thyme stayed awake all night to watch the stars.</p>
                <div class='illustration'><img src="empire-02.png"></img></div>
            <p>In the morning the child sat up, rubbing the seeds from her eyes and looking around for Thyme. Thyme rose from the fields to greet her, sweetsmelling and wet with dew.</p>
            <p>"I have to wash my face," the child told him. "I'd like something to eat too, and a drink of water."</p>
            <p>Thyme nodded, for he understood that she indeed needed all those things. "There is a brook nearby," he said. "It lies to the east, but that cannot be helped."</p>
            <p>He led her to it; and as they walked, his beard, which had been white as winter snow, grew frosty, and at last iron gray.</p>
            <p>As for the child, because she walked with Thyme, she became younger and younger. When they reached the brook, she was hardly older than she had been when Thyme had seen her playing peace in the dusty road. Nevertheless, she scrubbed her face and hands, then drank from her hands, scooping up handful after handful of clear, cold water from the brook while Thyme picked berries for them both.</p>
            <p>"Why is the water so cold, Father Thyme?" she asked him. "Did it sleep out all night too, but with nobody to cover it?"</p>
            <p>Thyme chuckled, for he was beginning to recall the ways of men, and even something of the ways of little girls. "No," he told her. "Trust me, my child, when I say that water you drink has been busy all night dashing down past rocks and roots. But it has run down from high mountain slopes where even Crocus has not yet set foot."</p>
            <p>"Is that where the men fight?" she asked.</p>
            <p>Thyme nodded. "For a thousand years your Easterlings have warred with the Men of the West, making the high meadows of the mountainsides their battlefields. Doubtless there is blood in that water you drink, though there is too little for us to see. Do you still wish to drink it?"</p>
            <p>The child hesitated, but at last scooped more. "Yes," she said, "because that's all there is to drink."</p>
            <p>Thyme nodded again. "I drink pure rain, for the most part, mingled with a little dew, and there is no blood in either. You could not do that; you would become very thirsty, and die before the next rain. Drink as you must."</p>
            <p>Hand in hand they walked west, eating wild raspberries from Thyme's old hat, the child hardly higher than Thyme's legs. But soon the top of her head had reached Thyme's waist; and when the last raspberry was eaten, she was nearly as tall as he, and they walked on arm in arm across the plain.</p>
            <p>Thus they came to green Vert, that great city, the Boast of the East; and all who saw the two thought them a grandfather and his granddaughter, and smiled to hear Thyme ask if the road was not too weary for her, or the way too hard; for the child had grown lithe and long of limb, red-cheeked as an apple, with lips like two raspberries and eyes like the midnight sky.</p>
            <p>Now it so happened that Patizithes—the Prince of the East, the Lord of All the Lands That Lie Beyond Lagous, the Margrave of the Magitz, and the Wildgrave of the Wood, the youngest son of the Emperor and heir to the Throne of Imperial Jade (for he mourned five brothers)—saw them enter the city. Patizithes had been inspecting the Guard of the City Wall, a guard of boys and old men, and fretting at the duty, for he wished to ride to the war, feeling that he might win in a week what had not been won by his fierce father's war-tried warriors in a millennium. But when his gaze strayed from the boots and the buttons, the well-buffed broadswords of the boys and the burnished bucklers of the old men, he saw the child (grown a young woman) who walked with Thyme.</p>
            <p>Quickly he dismissed that feeble formation, drew off three rich rings and dropped them into his pocket, and canting his cap at an elegant angle, dashed down to greet them at the gate while they were still being scrutinized by the sentries.</p>
            <p>"Old man," said the senior sentry, "you must tell me who you are, and what it is you want in our city."</p>
            <p>"I am but a poor eremite, my son," Thyme told him, "as you see. For myself, I want nothing from your proud city, and that is what I shall receive from it—a few broken bricks, perhaps, and a pretty fragment of malachite. But this child wishes to learn of peace, and of the war that took her father, and I have come with her, for she could not have reached this place without me."</p>
            <p>Precisely at this point, Prince Patizithes appeared. "My friend," he said, smiling at the senior sentry (who was utterly astonished to be addressed so by the proud young paladin), "even you ought to be able to see that these travelers mean no harm. The old man's too feeble to overpower anyone, and while those eyes might vanquish whole armies, such conquests are no breach of the peace."</p>
            <p>The senior sentry saluted. "It's my duty, sir, to question everyone who seeks to enter by this gate."</p>
            <p>"And you have done so," Prince Patizithes pointed out. "I merely remind you that it's equally your duty to admit them when they've satisfied you as to their good intentions. I know them, and I vouch for them. Are you satisfied?"</p>
            <p>The senior sentry saluted a second time. "Yes, sir! I am indeed, sir."</p>
            <p>"Then come, dear friends." Prince Patizithes pointed to a little park, where a fragrant fountain played. "This quiet spot exists only to welcome you. Wouldn't you like to bathe your feet in its cool waters? You can sit on the coping while I bring you a little food and a bottle of wine from that inn.</p>
            <p>While Thyme threw his long length on the soft green grass, the charming child permitted Prince Patizithes to hold her hand as she stepped across the cool stone coping and sat waving her weary feet in the fountain's chanting waters. "How could your city have known we were coming?" she asked. "So as to have this park ready for us?"</p>
            <p>Prince Patizithes pursed his lips, feigning to ponder. "We knew that someone worthy of such a place must come at last," he whispered warmly. "And now we see that we were correct. How do you feel about duck? Our city's as famous for its teal as for its hospitality."</p>
            <p>The child nodded and smiled, and when Patizithes had gone, stepped under the silver spray, washing the dust of many roads from her hair and face, and wetting the thin shift that reached now scarcely to her thighs. "Isn't he nice?" she asked Thyme.</p>
            <p>"No," Thyme told her, sitting up. "No, my child, not he, though I may bring out some good in him before the end. He is brave because he has never been injured; generous, but he has not toiled for the food. You may trust me when I say that much more than that is required."</p>
            <p>"But he likes me, and I'm a big girl now."</p>
            <p>"Then ask yourself whether he would like you still, were you still a little one," Thyme told her. "That is the test."</p>
            <p>"I still am a little girl inside," the child said. "It's only that going with you has changed my outside, Father Thyme."</p>
            <p>‘As he is still a little boy within," Thyme told her. "He has been changed as you have been changed, and in no other way. Do you see that woman with the basket of limes on her shoulder? She has borne many children; but the child in her is no larger than the child in you."</p>
            <p>"Is there a child in everybody?" the child asked.</p>
            <p>"Yes," Thyme told her. "But in some it is a dead child. And they are far worse than this young man."</p>
            <p>Prince Patizithes appeared as he spoke. The proud prince bore a patinated brass platter—a servile service he had never performed before—but since he had seen the servants and slaves of his father's palace present comestibles in casseroles all his life, he lifted its lid with a fine flourish. "Roast teal," he announced, smiling. "Well stuffed with chestnuts and oysters, or so I am assured."</p>
            <p>The charmed child served him an answering smile that pierced his poor heart.</p>
            <p>"Wine too!" To cover his confusion, he brought a cobweb-cloaked bottle of Vert's best vintage from one pocket, popping the cork with a tug of his teeth, and taking two tall tumblers from the other. "Wine for you, Father. . . ?"</p>
            <p>"Thyme," Thyme told him.</p>
            <p>"Father Thyme. And wine for this fair lady. Your niece, perhaps, sir?"</p>
            <p>"My adopted daughter, my son." Thyme took the tumbler and tossed it down.</p>
            <p>"Won't you join us?" the child asked as she sipped.</p>
            <p>The proud prince shrugged sorrowfully. "Alas, that rat-infested inn had only those two tumblers. But if I might have a swallow from yours. . . ?"</p>
            <p>Shyly the child gave him her glass, and pointedly he pressed his lips to its rim, where her own ruby lips had lingered only a moment before.</p>
            <p>Thyme cleared his throat. "We have come to your city so that this child might see of what stuff war is made. You seem to be a person of consequence here. Would it be possible for you to arrange an interview with one of your generals for her? I would be grateful, and so would she, I know."</p>
            <p>The deceitful prince dipped into the dressing for a savory oyster. "I could try to set up an interview with our emperor's son for you two," he said slowly. "It wouldn't be easy, perhaps. But I could try."</p>
            <p>The child asked eagerly, "Or with the emperor himself? I want to ask him to make peace with the Men of the West."</p>
            <p>"Those yellowbellies?" The prince spat. "I don't think my—our beloved ruler would really go so far as to punish you for that. But to be honest, dear maiden, I don't believe it will be of the slightest use."</p>
            <p>Thyme tipped the cobweb-wrapped bottle above his tumbler. "Nor do I," he said sorrowfully. "Except to her."</p>
            <p>"If it will be of use to her, I'll arrange it," Patizithes promised. "But first she must be dressed for court. It won't do for her to be presented in that ragged shift, though you, as a peregrine holy man, may dress as you like."</p>
            <p>Thyme tasted the wondrous wine in his tumbler thoughtfully. "Yes, I suppose you're right, my son. The child must have some new clothes."</p>
            <p>"And I'll see to that too," the prince pledged. "I know a seamstress who makes gowns for the most fashionable court ladies. I suppose it might take her a month to run one up, though; you could stay with me till it's ready. Have you that much time?"</p>
            <p>"All that we require, my son," Thyme told him. Thyme was taking charge of the teal, of which the lovely child had claimed no more than a leg, and Prince Patizithes was utterly astonished to see him bite the bare bones as easily as the child had eaten the meat.</p>
            <p>"That's settled, then," the prince said with satisfaction; and as soon as the two had made their meal, he brought them both to the seamstress, who curtsied like a countess when she saw the royal patron at her drawingroom door.</p>
            <p>"Madame Gobar." Patizithes pointed.</p>
            <p>"What a wonderful figure!" The seamstress sighed, chucking the child beneath the chin. "You've hardly need of me, my dear, with that tiny waist and that face. Any little dressmaker could wrap you up in silk and slap on a few pearls and pack you off to court looking like a princess."</p>
            <p>"Which she will never be, worse luck," the prince pointed out. "And I beg you not to be extravagant with those pearls."</p>
            <p>"You're right, of course, Highness," the seamstress said. "Elegance and simplicity. And a silk that's like spring grass. I'll get it."</p>
            <p>When the seamstress had slipped off to her storeroom, the child whispered, "Why does she call you Highness, kind sir?"</p>
            <p>"It's merely a courtesy title." Prince Patizithes soothed her smoothly. "A bit of flattery our city's tradespeople lavish upon those whose station in life is somewhat more elevated than their own."</p>
            <p>Thyme sighed. "I see."</p>
            <p>The seamstress had brought a bolt of bright silk. She laid it on her table and put up a painted screen to close one corner of her chamber. "If you'll just step behind this, my dear," she chirped, "and slip out of that—that thing you're wearing, I'll take your measurements."</p>
            <p>The beautiful child nodded dutifully, and slipped behind the screen, soon followed by the seamstress.</p>
            <p>The prince looked grim. "This will take half the day, I'm afraid. We should have kept the wine."</p>
            <p>"I did," Thyme told him, bringing the bottle from beneath his colorless old cloak. "No glasses, though, I fear. I have bad luck with them—they break so easily." He passed the black bottle to Prince Patizithes, who was somewhat surprised to find his wine gone sour.</p>
            <p>"That should do it," said the seamstress, stepping from behind her screen. "I shall have her gown ready—"</p>
            <p>Thyme's cold eyes caught hers. There was the slightest of pauses.</p>
            <p>"— by tomorrow. Tomorrow before nones, I should imagine."</p>
            <p>"Fine," Thyme told her.</p>
            <p>"And I've loaned her an old dress to wear until then," the seamstress proceeded breathlessly, "that is, she really doesn't have to return it."</p>
            <p>"We thank you," Thyme told her; and as he spoke, the child stepped silently from behind the seamstress's screen, scarcely less lovely than a summer sunrise.</p>
            <p>The prince gasped.</p>
            <p>Thyme's mouth twitched, and he suppressed a smile. "This audience you promised to arrange for us, do you think you could make it for tomorrow afternoon?"</p>
            <p>The child smiled too. "Yes, it would be marvelous. Could you?"</p>
            <p>"I think so." Prince Patizithes nodded nervously. "Anyway, I'll try. I— my house is outside the walls. It's only a league or so. My carriage is at the gate. I'll bring it if you like."</p>
            <p>"That might be best," Thyme told him. "This poor child and I have already walked some distance today."</p>
            <p>"Of course, of course!" Prince Patizithes darted through the dressmaker's door.</p>
            <p>Wearily, the child chose a chair. "He is nice," she told Thyme, "whether you think so or not."</p>
            <p>"As nice as peace?" Thyme asked her seriously.</p>
            <p>The seamstress simpered. "He's royal, my darling, and to be royal is ever so much better than to be nice."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps." Thyme turned away and walked to the window. He had hardly reached it when a whip cracked outside. The prince's equipage came rattling over the cobbles, and four footmen leaped to open its doors and draw out a deep green carpet.</p>
            <p>"Slippers!" The seamstress snapped her fingers. She flung herself into the search, but she had started too late. Lightly as any lady, the child smiled, gave her a little pat of parting, and put her hand into the prince's to help herself up the steep step. Frowning, Thyme followed, choosing a seat that faced the child.</p>
            <p>Prince Patizithes raced around the high rear wheels to duck through the other door and sit beside her. "We've shoes aplenty," he assured her. "Guests are always leaving them. You know how it is. You may have whichever pairs you like."</p>
            <p>The child thanked him with her eyes. "Are there green ones to go with my new dress?"</p>
            <p>Their coachman clucked his tongue to his team and cracked his black whip, the white horses leaped like lurchers after a leveret, and the prince's rich equipage jerked and jolted up the cobblestoned street.</p>
            <p>Patizithes laughed. "Why there's nothing but green ones, I'll take my oath. Because of the war, no lady of Vert has ever dared come to court in anything else."</p>
            <p>The sentries snapped erect and saluted them smartly as the ghostly team galloped through the postern gate. Patizithes had lied about his lodge (for it was to such a hunting house in the forest royal that his carriage carried them) when he said it lay but a league away; their horses were heaving and lathered with sweat whiter than they before all the weary watches that brought them to that lonely lodge were done.</p>
            <p>Yet it was lovely. The child stared at its tall chimneys and the thronging green trees of his father's forest with dazed delight. "Do you really live here?" she asked Patizithes in a bewitched whisper.</p>
            <p>"It's just a shed," he said. "I've a little place in town as well, but I know you'll be more comfortable here, where each of you can have a private apartment.</p>
            <p>At evening, while the whippoorwill called from the tall cherry tree and the nightingale rained her sweet notes on the world, Prince Patizithes and the changed child watched lovely Lune's head lifted by the slow rotation of Urth, and strolled the strange walks of the grotesque little garden the prince's poor grandfather had graded and planted while weeping for his wandering wife. Fragrant were the ramping pink roses and the fading forget-me-nots that night; but he found the child's musky tresses more fragrant far. And sweet though the birds' songs sounded, she found the prince's poor promises sweeter still.</p>
            <p>The two thought themselves alone. But all the while, one watched with the night-wide eyes of love. While they paced the pebbled paths between the silent flowers' spiked arrays, sage Thyme spied upon each pale sigh, peeping between bloom and leaf. And while they sat side by side and hand in hand on the stained stone bench beneath the spreading wisteria, Thyme watched unwinking from the midnight face of the mute sundial.</p>
            <p>And while they lay lazy on the soft grass, swearing the sweet oaths of love and longing, and whispering as they parted that though long lives might pass like a night and the New Sun sunder the centuries, yet never should they ever part, Thyme crept and cried, counting seconds that spilled with the sand from the hourglass, and scenting the soft breezes that cooled the child's burning cheek with his sad spice.</p>
                <div class='illustration'><img src="empire-03.png"></img></div>
            <p>The cock crowed as Thyme tapped impatient toes at the lofty lodge's deserted door, but the lovers slept long. It was nearly nones ere the coach came, carrying a pauciloquent child prince and a cheerless child. Together the three traveled along the rugged road that runs to the great green gates of Vert; but scarcely they spoke one word, and though Thyme turned anguished eyes from face to face, while watch waited upon watch, the cheated child never met that grim gaze. No more gave she her grave glance to the prince perched on the soft seat beside her, though her hand sought his, and sometimes failed to find it.</p>
            <p>In a space scarcely short of miraculous, Madame Gobar, the seamstress, had sewn such a green gown as any virgin nymph would willingly have worn to Vert's stiff court. "No pearls, you see, Your Highness," she told Prince Patizithes in the honest tones of one who takes an open pride in having done her duty. "A few small emeralds, and a nice big aquamarine or two. And she loves it—don't you, my dear?"</p>
            <p>She did. But before she could smooth her skirt and gaze a moment in the glass, off flew the coach, charging down the dirty streets of Vert and never pausing until it pulled up before the broad stair whose steps stretched to the portals of the palace.</p>
            <p>Soon and swiftly they were sent before the emporer's own imperial throne; and there the poor child voiced her plea for peace through chattering teeth.</p>
            <p>"I do not know how many men have died," she said. "Your Majesty will know that better than I; but I know my father was one of them, and that as we came here we saw unworked fields everywhere, houses falling to ruin, and women plowing—plowing badly—when the plowing should have been done weeks ago. We saw women sowing grain instead of shirts, cattle and sheep that had been killed by bears and wolves, and hungry children."</p>
            <p>"Boys who can never grow into strong soldiers," Thyme added, addressing the emperor, "and girls who will never breed them."</p>
            <p>Some shocked courtiers gasped at all this, grabbing their gowns and clutching their cloaks as though to keep them clear of contamination. But the stern, scarred old emperor never heeded them, nodding his head and neither smiling nor scowling.</p>
            <p>"I have lost my father," the child continued. "I know that you have lost five fine sons. Only one is left to you. I love him, and so do all your other loyal subjects, I feel sure. Won't you make peace?"</p>
            <p>"Peace has been made many times," the emperor said solemnly. "And each peace has only led to a new war. What is the good of treaties and truces where there is no trust? The fighting stops, and our enemy rearms."</p>
            <p>With that, the elderly emperor's voice sank to silence, and a sullen silence hung heavy over all that gay green gathering. Some aged courtier coughed, and there was the faint scuffle of many shuffling feet. Prince Patizithes strode forward to stand beside the confounded child. Silently, he slipped his hand into hers and led her to an alcove. "I promised you an audience," he told the child coldly. "I didn't promise you that it would help things, and as you see, it hasn't."</p>
            <p>Thyme told her, "You tried, and that's something not many have done."</p>
            <p>Just then, they were joined by a general, an old officer whose bottlegreen uniform bore many an enameled medal, besides the usual battle honors. His hair was gray, his visage grim, his eyes the green of Vert. "Your Highness," this green general growled, "may I interrupt? I think it will only take a moment."</p>
            <p>"You already have, Generalissimo," the prince pointed out.</p>
            <p>"You are young," the green general said gravely, "and so you think wisdom is to be found in pink cheeks and bright eyes. We who bear the weight of past years know that white hair or a bald head is a better indication of it. Since you have brought this old, and I suppose holy, hermit to the court, I would like to make use of whatever hard-won wisdom he may possess while I can."</p>
            <p>"Then speak, my son," Thyme urged graciously.</p>
            <p>The hoary-headed old officer did not hesitate. "How can we win?"</p>
            <p>"You may win," Thyme told him, "when your army is dressed in yellow."</p>
            <p>For a moment the grim old general stood stunned. "You can counsel me to dress my soldiers like the enemy," he said slowly, "but I assure you that though I am master of all our armies, I cannot do such a thing. Nor would I do it if I could. I would rather lose the war than do as you suggest."</p>
            <p>"Then you will not have to," Thyme told him. "Because I will do it for you."</p>
            <p>The old officer turned upon his heel and left them without another word.</p>
            <p>Thyme watched his retreating back, then said softly to the child, "Now I too must go, and you must come with me."</p>
            <p>She shook her head. "I love Prince Patizithes," she said. Thinking that he still stood at her side, she looked around the alcove for him; but the prince of Vert had vanished.</p>
            <p>"You will come with me." Thyme turned and walked away, his black boots tapping the tessellated pavements of the palace like the ticking of some slow clock.</p>
            <p>"And he loves me!" the child whispered to herself; but there was no one but herself left to listen.</p>
                <div class='illustration'><img src="empire-04.png"></img></div>
            <p>That night it rained, and Thyme sat drinking drop for drop with a broad banyan tree. As soon as the last drizzle stopped and the sun was seen, he rose and returned to the road. He had not walked much more than a watch when he heard the hurrying child calling. "Thyme, Father Thyme, stop! Wait for me!"</p>
            <p>Without waiting, or turning toward her, or even so little as looking behind him, he murmured, "Thyme waits for no one," and walked on.</p>
            <p>It was early evening before she walked with him as she had when he had  brought her to the city. "I want to tell you," she said.</p>
            <p>"I know." He nodded. "And you are old enough now to tell Thyme, if you wish."</p>
            <p>Slowly then she spoke of the old garden and the green lawn on which she had lain with her lover; then of the threats he had thrown in her frightened face, because she had wished to remain where he would reign, though she would be called his concubine.</p>
            <p>"Did I do wrong?" she asked at last.</p>
            <p>"No." For a second Thyme stopped, turning to take in the road that returned to Vert. "Very small, child, are the flying days of love, and men and women must catch them when they can, if they are to know love at all."</p>
            <p>The child shook her head. "Wouldn't it be better not to know love at all, than to know a false love?"</p>
            <p>"No," Thyme answered again, turning back to their way once more and taking her by the hand. "In the desert, travelers see pools of water where no water is; but those who see these pools know how real water must look, if ever real water is found."</p>
            <p>So Thyme spoke, and soon no more was said, though arm in arm they walked together. Their road had reached the rugged hills, and now wound higher and higher, turning and twisting till at length it mounted to the mountains. There it went with a wider, fairer way, where green grenadiers counted cadence for callow conscripts, brave youths and young boys with pallid faces, who flaunted pikes.</p>
            <p>With each cubit they climbed, the cherry-lipped child who had ventured to Vert vanished. Lines led from her eyes to her ears, and strands of silver streaked her once sleek hair. The food they found and the rough rations Thyme took from some of the soldiers seemed to thicken her hips and bulk her breasts; and at last, with their road long lost, when they went their way guided only by the onrush of the green emperor's army, she laid palsied palms upon her broadened belly and knew there the feeble flutter of new life.</p>
            <p>Drawn the child looked before the dawn, in the hour when her own child came. Then Thyme himself knew terror; for it is not so (as some say) that Thyme heals all things, though healing he has. But Thyme himself tied the cord and comforted his tired child, pressing her babe to her breast.</p>
            <p>"Now I must go," Thyme told her. "You must have food and good water, and rags with which to diaper your son. Keep him warm while I am away, and yourself as well." He set sticks by her hand, so that she might feed their fire, saying, "I will return as soon as the Increate wills it."</p>
            <p>Then night closed over his old gray cloak; he was gone like some ghost. The chilled child lay alone save for her son, alone and lonely, shaking with the flickering, guttering flames in the white wind that whipped the wide green skirt Madame Gobar had made, shaking too with terror as she heard the wild howls of the wolves that batten on battles, the slayers of the slain.</p>
            <p>More than these, she feared the fierce soldiers who surged about the wretched brush that sheltered her and her son. They who had been boys had been made beasts, bent if not broken by their battles, the henchmen of Hell and the disciples of Death—thus she thought. Then her babe embraced her breast, sucking his mama's sweet milk; and soon her heart soared. Such was the mutability of his mother. Such, indeed, are the shiftings in all human hearts.</p>
            <p>Somewhere a stick snapped, and her bliss broke with it. She staggered to her feet, and would have fled if she could; but she could scarcely stand. Part of her wretched protection was rolled away. A short sword and a worn face caught the firelight. For a moment that seemed a month, her eyes met his. "By the book!" the startled soldier swore. "What in the name of awful Abaia are you two up to?"</p>
            <p>"My son's having his breakfast, as you see," she said; "and I was resting, until you came."</p>
            <p>The soldier lowered his sword and pushed through the brush. "Then sit down." He held out his hand; and when the child had clasped it, and sat as he had said, he sat himself, sitting so his broad back blocked the hole he had made in their screen of brush.</p>
            <p>"Did you see our fire?" she asked. "I feared someone would, though Thyme piled as many dead bushes and branches as he could around this windfall before he built it."</p>
            <p>"Thyme?"</p>
            <p>"My father. Or at least that's what I call him, since he cares for me. You needn't be afraid. Thyme's and old man, you can kill him easily, I'm sure."</p>
            <p>The soldier shook his head, his eyes on the baby boy. "I wouldn't do that. What's his name?"</p>
            <p>The child had not yet chosen one, not knowing one would so soon be needed. Now she blurted, "Barrus!" Barrus had been her brother, in days that seemed a dream. Her bold brother, and her father's favorite.</p>
            <p>"Ha!" the soldier said. "The handsome one, eh? Well, he's handsome enough, I'll admit, for somebody so new to this world. But may I ask what you're doing here, on a battlefield in a ball gown?"</p>
            <p>"Seeing war," she said. "I think so that I'll know what it is when Thyme brings peace."</p>
            <p>"You'd better go back home," the soldier told her. "Before you're killed you and your child too. Before some fool shoots you, or you starve or freeze to death."</p>
            <p>"We're going on, I think." Barrus had released her nipple; he was asleep. She slid the strap up so her silk bodice hid her breast. "Over the mountains to the Yellow Empire."</p>
            <p>"In that green dress? That's suicide." A brass clasp held his soldier's sagum. He opened the clasp, pulled off the cloak, and handed it to her. "This was green when it was new, but it's gray now. It may not get you through alive, but it'll keep you warmer till you die."</p>
            <p>Tearfully, she tried to thank him, though she only sobbed and stammered.</p>
            <p>"Don't worry about me." The soldier shrugged. "There's plenty of dead men out there, and their cloaks don't keep the chill off any longer. I'll get another one—a newer one, with any luck." He rose to go.</p>
            <p>Winking back her weeping, she blew him a brave kiss. He caught it, smiled suddenly (he seemed but a boy when he smiled), and was gone as the dark gave way to dawn. Hot tears streaked her tired cheeks; she closed his cloak about herself and Barrus, her baby boy.</p>
            <p>So Thyme saw them when he pushed aside the brush—wrapped in warm wool, and peacefully asleep. When the child woke and Thyme chided her for crying, she would say only that those who have seen clean water in the desert's depths, without drinking, are entitled to tears.</p>
                <div class='illustration'><img src="empire-05.png"></img></div>
            <p>Slowly they mounted the mountains' stony sides, old Thyme taking her hand and the child cradling her child. In time of peace, travelers would trudge the passes, as Thyme assured her, At present, divisions defended every defile, holding each high road against whole armies.</p>
            <p>A bit before evensong, they were to witness such a struggle. Thyme stopped, pointing for the child with the pine staff he had chosen before they had left the last trees behind. "Do you see the green squares?" he asked sadly. "This is no skirmish, but some major matter."</p>
            <p>It seemed a storm had struck the mountain-cut below. The arrows flashed like lightning, and they heard the thunder of the guns. A surging green square gained ground, then wavered and went out like the lambent flame of some snuffed taper; a second square crept up the slope, covering the corpses of the slain.</p>
            <p>"See how resolutely they advance." Thyme tapped a stone with his staff as he spoke. "Determined to win or die! Would you care to say which you think it will be?"</p>
            <p>She shook her head. She felt sure the soldier whose wool sagum she wore served in that square, though she told herself truly there was no way of knowing. Like the last, this square perished in the pass.</p>
            <p>A yellow column came, sliding along like a snake from the wild wadis of the West. Green cavalry gave it check, then gave way. Scattered green soldiers followed, fleeing.</p>
            <p>"The westerners have the victory," she said to Thyme, "and soon they will take Vert. Then there will be peace."</p>
            <p>Thyme took up his staff and stood, ready to resume their march. "That pass has changed hands many times," he told the child. "And the war is not yet won."</p>
                <div class="break"></div>
            <p>That night they camped near the enemy army. "Now wash your dress," Thyme told her. "I will keep my eyes off you." She did as he bid, scrubbing her soiled green gown in a sparkling stream. Sometimes soldiers stopped to talk with her. She was covered by her cloak, and she feigned a friendliness that was soon sincere. "Yellow will never yield," the newest recruits replied when she pleaded for peace. The older soldiers only shrugged, or spit, or spoke of something else. Although their accent was strange, she soon ceased to notice it, speaking just as they spoke. No one she had known wore yellow, yet save for their yellow coats the young men could have been her cousins.</p>
            <p>"Will there never be peace?" she asked Thyme when her dress was dry.</p>
            <p>"You will see," he said, and would say no more.</p>
                <div class="break"></div>
            <p>When the next day dawned, her baby, Barrus, could walk with his mother. Thyme found him trousers and a shirt, she dared not ask where, and she shortened the little legs, and the sleeves of the shirt. From the peaks they could see the plains, and in the misty distance the spires of Zant, that unyielding yellow city, glorious with gold.</p>
            <p>Barrus told tales of days she was sure he had only dreamed, chattering to the child of childish notions she had never known, then comforting her with kisses. "My mom forgets, doesn't she?" He giggled, grinning. "But you always remember, Father Thyme, don't you?"</p>
            <p>Thyme sighed and shook his head. "It is my task to wipe away. As you will learn."</p>
            <p>They found a road that roved from wood to wood. Stunted shrubs made way for white pine, alder, and pale aspen. Barrus had a knife now, and cut a clever whistle with which he piped their progress from peak to pass, and at last to the mountain meadows. He did as Thyme told him, but defiantly, not freely. At each step they took he grew taller, and more sulky and more sullen. "I can beat Thyme," he told his mother, tapping his toes to a tune he had taken from the thrush.</p>
            <p>"Please don't!" She felt frightened; Thyme was their only friend.</p>
            <p>The great sage grimaced. "They always think they can, at his age."</p>
            <div class='illustration'><img src="empire-06.png"></img></div>
            <p>A day of drizzle brought them to the bright gates of Zant, weary and wet. Sentries stopped them, guards in gorgeous golden armor who addressed them in the babyish voices of boys or asked the quavering questions of senescence.</p>
            <p>"We only want food and shelter," Thyme told them. "Food, and a fire, and a little peace. Those are our only reasons for coming to Zant."</p>
            <p>Perhaps the guards pitied the palsied old man, for they opened the gilt gates for them.</p>
            <p>"Are we going to go to an inn?" Barrus asked. He pointed to the painted boards grouped near the gate: the Golden Goblin, the Pilgrim's Pause, the Royal Roast, and many more, all pied with paint to picture the Goose Girl, the Pilgrim putting down his pack, the Singing Oriole, and so on, so that even those who could not read the names could take their ease at an inn in any case.</p>
            <p>"No," Thyme told him. "Or at least I hope not. This is the country of gold, so nowhere does gold buy less than here."</p>
            <p>He stopped at the step of a private dwelling, rapping its dark door with a ring hung for that purpose. "Madame," he said to the wary woman who came to his knock, "we are poor travelers, seeking a lodging for a night or two at a price we can afford. Can you tell us of some decent family who might take us in? We cannot pay much, but we will lay down ready money for whatever we get."</p>
            <p>"No." The dour woman would have shut her door and shot its bar, but that Thyme's blunt black boot blocked its edge.</p>
            <p>"If not yourself, perhaps some neighbor?"</p>
            <p>"I don't dislike any of my neighbors that much," the dour woman told Thyme. "Now get your foot off my threshold, or I'll call the dog."</p>
            <p>Thyme stepped back, bowing as her door banged shut.</p>
            <p>A meager little man in a long yellow cloak stopped as it slammed, looking as wet as they were. "I heard what you said. I've got a room in a decent enough house, a couple of streets over. They might take you and your wife—"</p>
            <p>"My daughter, my son."</p>
            <p>"And your daughter, I meant to say. And your grandson, if you can pay."</p>
            <p>Thyme thanked him, and they went with him, down one sodden street and up another, until at length they arrived at an old-fashioned high city-house, ornamented with carvings now decayed, with a second story overhanging the first, a third that overhung the second, and giddy garrets that overlooked the wall.</p>
            <p>Cheaping with the landlady, Thyme got the child and Barrus a garret and rented a similar room for himself. When the meager man who had guided them to the house had gone, their new hostess asked them how well they knew him.</p>
            <p>"Less than you, I'm sure." Thyme knelt by the tiled hearth that was now his own, for this night if not forever. There was a little tinder and a log or two.</p>
            <p>"You won't get that burning," said Barrus.</p>
            <p>"In time," Thyme told him. His flint scratched his steel, sending a shower of flying sparks to the tinder.</p>
            <p>"Because," the landlady continued confidentially, choosing to chat with the child, "we really know nothing about him here, except that he pays."</p>
            <p>Thyme puffed his tinder. "He seems an honest enough man." A small swirl of smoke curled toward the chimney.</p>
            <p>The child shivered; her cloak was soaked from hem to collar. "When he has that going," she said to her son, "you should borrow a stick to light ours."</p>
            <p>Barrus snapped, "I'm not an idiot, Mother."</p>
            <p>The landlady laughed. "Maybe not, but you could fool some people, boy. Now, none of your sass to me, understand? Or all of you will be out in the street.</p>
            <p>"Our lodger, I was going to say, pays us by the month. But sometimes the only time we see him is when he pays."</p>
            <p>"The very time," Thyme remarked tartly, "when so many are invisible."</p>
            <p>The landlady laughed again. "And don't I know it! Still, you can't help wondering where he goes and what he does."</p>
            <p>A feeble flame flickered beside Thyme's tinder, darkening the white wood before it dwindled and disappeared. "Does he share supper with your family?" He blew on the bright embers and fanned them with his hand.</p>
            <p>She nodded knowingly. "Sometimes. Mutton tonight, like I told you."</p>
            <p>Barrus said, "It's burning right now, I bet."</p>
            <p>"It'll keep, boy. Besides, I want to see if you three need anything more before I go down to look at it. I don't climb the steps more than I have to." She was short and stout.</p>
            <p>"More blankets," Barrus said bitterly. "And more firewood."</p>
            <p>"There aren't any more blankets. You can spread your coat on your bed, the same as we do. And if you want any more wood, boy, you'll have to fetch it yourself—I'm not carrying another stick up here. Come along, and I'll show you where it is."</p>
            <p>The child spread chilled fingers before Thyme's tiny blaze. "What do you think?"</p>
            <p>"I think it will catch that smallest log now," Thyme told her. "Though it would be better if we had more tinder."</p>
            <p>"About her lodger, Father Thyme. You know everything."</p>
            <p>The old sage shook his head. "I find out everything," he said, "sooner or later. But I don't know everything. A fellow that rents a room and uses it only now and then? That's a rich man who wants someplace to go when he's not where he usually is. We'll learn more at supper."</p>
            <p>And so they did. There were two sober tinkers who rented a room together, as well as themselves and the meager man who had helped them locate the lodging, and the landlord and landlady. The meager man asked clever questions of the tinkers until he learned that neither had left the city since he had last seen them. Then he turned to Thyme to ask about their travels.</p>
            <p>"Over the mountains." Thyme took a pair of potatoes from the big blue bowl that the landlord handed him. "And it was the making of the boy, but the destruction of my daughter, or nearly."</p>
            <p>"Bad weather there," their landlord allowed. His good wife gave him a long look, and he added, "Or so I've heard. I can't say I've ever been there."</p>
            <p>The child peered into her chipped plate, which was still empty.</p>
            <p>"It was worse here." Thyme tried to pass her the potatoes, but was waved away. Barrus took the big bowl. "Not as cold as it was in the mountains, but the rain makes you feel it more."</p>
            <p>A worn old woman licked chapped lips in the child's plate, her wavering reflection as dim as her dead eyes.</p>
            <p>"Of course, the war made everything ten times worse." An earthenware ladle drowned the dim woman in greasy mutton gravy.</p>
            <p>"I'm sorry to hear that," the meager man muttered. He and Thyme talked for some time; he seemed eager to learn everything he could about both armies.</p>
            <p>"Will there ever be peace?" the child asked them.</p>
            <p>"When we win," their landlord said loudly. Hasty for his favor, the two tinkers banged the battered tabletop with their spoons.</p>
            <p>Without speaking loudly, the meager lodger managed to make himself heard above the uproar. "Our emperor has pledged a rich reward for anyone who advises him on how peace may be acheived."</p>
            <p>"Then your emperor is a wise man," Thyme told him. To the child, Thyme's tones seemed changed, as if an occult knowledge added weight now to words she did not wholly understand.</p>
            <p>"And that is pleasant news for us," Thyme continued. "For we've come here expressly to see him."</p>
            <p>Their landlady looked happy to hear it. "You may have to wait quite a while," she said, "if that's what you've come for. We don't often see him ourselves. We can give you your rooms for a week, for five times the daily rent."</p>
            <p>"That's kind of you." Thyme tasted a piece of brown bread before laying it on his plate and larding it with a ladleful of the gray gravy. "I think you mentioned something of that sort while we were getting the fire started."</p>
            <p>"About the rent?"</p>
            <p>"About the emperor. You mentioned you didn't see him much."</p>
            <p>"I don't remember that," she said.</p>
            <p>"Then I was mistaken." Thyme turned from her to look at her lodger. "It was you she was speaking of, perhaps."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps it was." The lodger pushed away his plate. "I don't want to take the time of the whole company, but if you could come to my room after dinner, I might be able to advise you about the best ways of getting a glimpse of our emperor, though he doesn't appear in public often."</p>
            <p>"I've finished now." Thyme took the napkin from his lap and laid it beside his knife. "I see you're finished as well."</p>
            <p>"Your poor daughter hasn't eaten much."</p>
            <p>Thyme nodded. "True, but her appetite will be better tomorrow, I think."</p>
            <p>The landlord laid a hand on his arm. "No bread pudding? My wife's bread pudding's quite famous."</p>
            <p>The two tinkers looked ready to laugh with pure pleasure. "All the more for us," said the smaller. "I'll take the old man's," added the taller.</p>
            <p>The child stood up, scraping back her chair. "May I come with my father?" she asked softly.</p>
            <p>The meager man began, "Possibly—"</p>
            <p>"She must." Thyme took her in tow. "Now what about you, Barrus? Which will it be, peace or pudding?"</p>
            <p>"We don't have pease today," the landlady put in. "They're a bit tough, so far into the season."</p>
            <p>"Then I'll take pudding," Barrus said sullenly.</p>
            <p>"And we will see you later." Thyme led the child to the stair. "It will be on the floor below ours, I suppose."</p>
            <p>The lodger nodded as he slipped past them. "I'll have to unlock the door."</p>
            <p>"You are fortunate," Thyme told him when they were seated inside. "Our rooms have no locks. Of course, we've little to leave in them when we go."</p>
            <p>The meager man smiled mischievously. "I'm afraid I enjoy frustrating our good hostess."</p>
            <p>"She's the sort who snoops through drawers? I suppose so; she seems the kind of woman who would."</p>
            <p>The meager man nodded. "Yet there are others who discover more secrets, without spying."</p>
            <p>"True," Thyme told him. "And kind men who repent of their kindness when they find that others are clever."</p>
            <p>"If you know my secret," the meager man said seriously, "you also know that I have means of silencing those who know secrets."</p>
            <p>"Which need not be used in this case." Thyme rose and went to the window, where he stood staring out at the smoking chimney pots of Zant.</p>
            <p>"I'm glad to hear that."</p>
            <p>"My daughter and I will leave your city in the morning. In a day or two, we will have left its empire. I will not speak; nor will she, I assure you."</p>
            <p>Bewildered, the child stared from Thyme to the meager man and back. "Please," she said. "What are you two talking about?"</p>
            <p>Thyme turned. "The emperors of Vert trace their line from the first emperor for twenty generations," he said softly. "It is not so here in Zant. Here emperor has deposed emperor, till at last one who was well liked was murdered in a manner so foul that the people would not consent to his murderer's coronation. They chose another general in his place, a hero of humble birth who had risen through the ranks and was famous for his courage." Thyme glanced toward the meager man as he finished speaking, a charged gaze that told the child much more than his mere words.</p>
            <p>"I understand—I think."</p>
            <p>The meager man made a little motion of impatience. "Yes, I'm the Yellow Emperor. How did you know? Give me a simple, straightforward answer, please."</p>
            <p>"I had your picture." From the burse at his belt, Thyme took a copper coin. "When we were going over the mountains, I stole some clothes for the boy."</p>
            <p>"From my dead soldiers?"</p>
            <p>"Yes. A few had a little money, which I thought might be useful in Zant. I confess I did not know how useful. When the Increate is with anyone, there rises a tide that bears into its harbor any ship that carries him."</p>
            <p>"Millions of people have these coins."</p>
            <p>"You asked me for a simple, straightforward answer," Thyme reminded the emperor.</p>
            <p>"Give me your subtle and complex answer, then."</p>
            <p>"Not terribly subtle, I fear. Nor terribly complex. It is true that millions have such coins, and yet do not know you when they pass you in the street; but that is only because they cannot conceive that they might encounter someone so exalted someday—someone who holds the power of life and death over every one of them. I know otherwise; there is someone who holds the power of being or unbeing over me, and I shall encounter that someone at the end of Thyme. Thus I understand that such meetings are not impossible."</p>
            <p>The child smiled. "Isn't he wonderful?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed he is," the emperor admitted. "It was nothing that I said?"</p>
            <p>"Nothing specific," Thyme told him. "But our hostess had told us you seldom use the room you rent from her. My daughter asked me about it, and I indicated to her that you were perhaps a man of some wealth, and not what you seemed. You could have been a highwayman, but you lacked the blustering ways and impressive physique those fellows use to overawe their victims. You had the manners of a gentleman, without the arrogance that is often conferred by birth—we had been with Prince Patizithes in Vert, and so my recollection of that sort of arrogance had been refreshed."</p>
            <p>"I see."</p>
            <p>"When you questioned me at our meal, my first thought was that you were a spy—an agent of the emperor's, or of whoever gathers facts for him; but such a spy would have been much more interested in the enemy's army than in his own. I asked myself who might have an equal interest in each. A general kept in the capital, perhaps, but such a general could not appear as a poor man in a place where rooms were let to lodgers. Then I recalled that the emperor had been a general, and that an emperor can do as he chooses. So I looked at the coin."</p>
            <p>The child ventured a very small sound.</p>
            <p>"Yes?" the Yellow Emperor inquired.</p>
            <p>"Sir—sire—I thought emperors just sat on their thrones. In the palace."</p>
            <p>"On occasions of state, I do," the emperor acknowledged. "But here in Zant, the occasions of state are as few as I can make them. Quite frankly, there are too many other things I have to do."</p>
            <p>"But isn't it dangerous?"</p>
            <p>"Just yesterday," the Yellow Emperor explained, "I learned of a plot to kill me as I slept. So you see it's less dangerous here than sleeping in my palace. More than a few of our august emperors have died in their beds, although not many were either old or ill. I find out everything that's going on in Zant this way, and that's a great deal less dangerous than not knowing."</p>
            <p>He paused, his pale fingers fumbling the worn arms of his chair as he watched the child's face. "Now may I ask what your business was with Prince Patizithes?"</p>
            <p>Spreading her hands helplessly, the child turned to Thyme, but he sat silent until she found her own anguished answer: "He let me talk to his father about peace. And he was my lover, at least for one night."</p>
            <p>The emperor nodded. "Neither actually surprises me much. Your father said something about peace to the boy, and you're still a beautiful woman. This was some years ago, I take it?"</p>
            <p>"No, only a few days—"</p>
            <p>"Yes," Thyme told him.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps fifteen years or so?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," Thyme said a second time.</p>
            <p>"I see." The emperor sighed. "They have a certain look about them, all that line. They're all a bit inbred, of course. I'm sorry, madame, but I can't permit you to take your son out of my domains. He's too valuable to me too valuable even now, while Patizithes is still alive. If the prince dies, he'll be invaluable."</p>
            <p>"If he will bring peace..."</p>
            <p>"He may bring victory," the emperor explained. "Or at least assist it."</p>
            <p>"And after the victory, will there be peace?"</p>
            <p>"Of course. And I will be a generous conqueror, you may trust me for that. Why, if— ah—"</p>
            <p>"Barrus," she supplied.</p>
            <p>"If Barrus proves a faithful vassal, he may well wind up on the throne of Vert. The Easterners would be more docile with someone of their own royal family to rule them, no doubt."</p>
            <p>The child felt that she was choking, but she said, "Then you may keep him. Please—will you remind him, sometimes, of his mother?"</p>
            <p>"I will," the emperor answered. "I pledge my word to it."</p>
            <p>"Father. . . ?"</p>
            <p>"You have done well," Thyme told her. "Is that what you wished to ask me?"</p>
            <p>His child shook her head. "No. In Vert you said that Vert might win when its men wore yellow clothes. Barrus will have a yellow uniform, I suppose. Is that what you meant?"</p>
            <p>"Perhaps. Or part of it."</p>
            <p>The emperor arose, strode across the room, and stared into Thyme's eyes. "You're a prophet! A sage! I should have known. And I take pride in my penetration—bah! What was it you meant? The whole of it."</p>
            <p>Thyme told him; and late on the following morning, when the rain had at last relented, and long after the cock crowed, Thyme and the charmed child set forth from that tottering, high house, and the strait old street in which it stood, and the gilded gate of Zant itself.</p>
            <div class='illustration'><img src="empire-07.png"></img></div>
            <p>While they walked, the child chirped, "I know this is very foolish, Father Thyme, but do you know I feel so happy! When I think back about it, I've felt sadder and sadder the whole time I've been with you. Now I'm happy again."</p>
            <p>The old sage shrugged, and stroked his snowy whiskers, and whispered, "Such is life, child. Child, life is such."</p>
            <p>So they proceeded, long league upon long league, the child chattering of the fields and flowers they passed, some pleasant pastures and their curious cattle. By the well-built bridges of the West they crossed its rushing rivers, the rivers that grind gold from their swirling sands. Soon they saw again the mighty mountains, standing like the walls of the world.</p>
            <p>At first, the climbing child feared for her hoary father, feeling him too feeble to face their steep screes and perilous paths; but Thyme seemed to straighten with every step, and the snowy beard he had brought to Zant grew grayer and grayer from glance to glance. Once they were waylaid by a brutal bandit who threatened them, frightening the child with a fusil. Thyme took it from him and grappled him to the ground. Only one rose, and the two went on.</p>
                <div class='illustration'><img src="empire-08.png"></img></div>
            <p>One morning, while they walked though a thicket of mountain laurels, the child lagged behind to look at them; for it seemed to her that some bore bright golden blossoms, and she had never seen laurels like them. Soon she found that the flowers belonged not to the trees, but to twining vines that choked them as they climbed. The child traced one down a trunk, ready to cut it at the root; but it grew from the eyes of a yellowing skull. She gasped and backed away.</p>
            <p>"That is the trumpet vine," Thyme told her. "And that skull you saw once wore a green cap. Did you poke about the roots of the tree as well?"</p>
            <p>In silent horror, she shook her head.</p>
            <p>Thyme thrust aside the thick, tangled thorns with his stick, bent, and brought up a bone in a matted mass of mould. "Here is the rib of one who once wore yellow. You see, he has turned his coat, even though he has lost the back on which he used to wear it." Gray green moss had indeed wrapped the rib.</p>
            <p>The child sighed, and sat herself upon a stone. "This is that place, isn't it? This is the pass where we saw the armies fight. I should have remembered it sooner, but then we were up there." Her eyes sought the spot along the snow line.</p>
            <p>"Yes," old Thyme agreed. "This is the place."</p>
            <p>"You said if each side tried to be more like the other, there might be peace. That's what you told the emperor."</p>
            <p>The sage did not sit (for Thyme rarely rests). "What you say is so, child. During the long years in which I have ringed Urth, I have seen that the more nation differs from nation, the difficult it is for one to trust another. Thus I advised each empire to make itself more like its foe. Alas, they were too much alike already. Each saw my advice not as a road to peace, but as ruse to win. The master of the green armies who rejected my counsel so rudely did so only that I might not guess what he planned; and the Yellow Emperor dressed legions in green only that they might not be fired upon as they advanced."</p>
            <p>The child shivered. "And now the laurels war with the vines."</p>
            <p>The old man nodded a struck a tree trunk (or perhaps the trumpet vine that twined it) with his staff. "I have changed their uniforms," he said. "But only they could halt their war."</p>
                <div class='break'></div>
            <p>Thus they came to green Vert, that great city, the Boast of the East; there they saw soldiers in argent armor standing guard at its gates, and a silver flag flying above the battlements of the bartizan. They did not stop. A gay girl the charmed child left the great green city, lissome and long-limbed, bright of eye and black of hair; but while she walked home with Thyme she dwindled, until such young men as they met on the way no longer stared but smiled. And ere old Urth turned her fair face from the sun, Thyme set her upon his shoulders.</p>
            <p>Small and sweet and soiled she was when their long walk was ended at a place where pease had rolled hither and thither across the road.</p>
            <p>"Goodbye for now," Thyme told her. "You may play with these pease, for the present."</p>
            <p>"Goodbye for now, Father Thyme," she said. "I love pease."</p>
            <p>"As do we all." Thyme took up his staff. "But it is so late in the season."</p>
            <p>She was picking up her pease when her fond brother, Barrus, found her. "I love you," the child cried, and threw her chubby arms about him.</p>
            <p>He fended her off, as boys believe they must, fighting not to let his love into his voice. "You're a very bad girl," he mumbled, and led her back to their mother's house.</p>
            <p>Often afterward she talked of Thyme, until at last her dear mother declared she must have seen the ghost of her grandfather, who had died that day. But though Thyme walked with her always, as he walks over all the world, his adopted daughter did not see him again; and this is his story.</p>
