							<p>hi all,<br/>
							<p>these past two weeks ive been working on a collection of the Game A Week games i made back in 2023</p>
							<img src="media/0412-c.png" 
								alt="first person view of a sci-fi room. stasis pods line the walls. a blue terminal lights the room. a window reveals stars and a planet." 
								class='devlog-img modal-img'>
                     <p>id like all the games to be in one place, with some cleaned up visuals, fixed bugs, and generally
                        trying to improve them without changing things too much
                     </p>
                     <p>its been interesting to play them all again after two years. it makes me want to do another Game A 
                        Week and hopefully get farther. maybe...
                     </p>

                     <p>the collection is going to have 17 games. i decided to not include the small demos that did not
                        really cohere. here is the final list:

                     <p>most of the games were originally made in Unity. i am making the collection in Godot, 
                        which means i am rebuilding a lot of things. i am happy to do this, since i am able to work a lot 
                        faster than i could in 2023, and it gives me the opportunity to make some changes.</p>
                     <h2>Deckchairs</h2>
							<img src="media/0412-a.gif" 
								alt="the player runs side to side carrying 4 chairs. a woman is fine dining." 
								class='devlog-img modal-img'>
                     <p>the platformer physics across all platformer games has been unified. 
                        each platformer game originally had slightly different
                        movement, depending on what felt right at the time. by the time i made 
                        Accounts of the Dead 2, the players jump height had multiplied by 4. this makes the games
                        disorienting to play in conjunction, especially if you play them out of order.
                     </p>
                     <p>other than a higher jump, the only changes Deckchairs got was polish. you can now carry multiple
                        chairs, and they are animated to sway slightly with your movement
                     </p>
                     <h2>Smores</h2>
							<img src="media/0412-d.png" 
								alt="the player battles a poorly drawn deer before a fireplace" 
								class='devlog-img modal-img'>
                        <p>Smores was pretty buggy and very unpolished. i also did not have time to create any sort of 
                           difficulty curve when making it. i want to avoid adding too much polish and making the game feel
                           totally different. i would like it to feel like "what if i had a little more time but no more skill."
                           in this case, i changed some encounters and made some new enemies, so that
                           should be interesting.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Poppy Heart & Rose</h2>
							<img src="media/0412-e.png" 
								alt="aA yellow cat is talking to a statue. the cat is saying 'I usually just eat the dirt.'" 
								class='devlog-img modal-img'>
                     <p>
                        Poppy Heart & Rose is in a unique position because the files were corrupted and i lost the code.
                        the final result is also buggy and does not work as intended. this means that the new version of the
                        game will be almost entirely new. fun!
                     </p>
                     <h2>Courtyard Detective</h2>
							<img src="media/0412-f.png" 
								alt="a dead tree in a smoggy courtyard" 
								class='devlog-img modal-img'>
                     <p>
                        being the first 3d game i made, i ran out of time building Courtyard Detective and it 
                        ended up with much more linear narrative than i had planned. i am taking this opportunity to 
                        give the player more options. hopefully this will feel a little more like an investigation.
                     </p>
                     <h2></h2>
							<p>those are the most major changes so far. hopefully you will be able to play it soon.</p>
                     <p>thank you for reading, and i will be back later this month<br/>
