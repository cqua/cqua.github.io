               <h1 id="Overview">Overview</h1><p>Each Kindred is a member of a clan. A clan is a group of
               vampires who all share common characteristics. Popular Kindred mythology suggests that all vampires are assumed to have
               descended from one common Kindred, the founder of that
               clan, though the identities of these founders is a mystery.
               When a vampire Embraces a new Kindred, the progeny is of
               the same clan as the progenitor. Certain vampire “sub-clans” also exist, known as bloodlines, but a vampire can never
               change clans.</p></div>
            <div>
               <h1 id="Daeva">Daeva</h1>
               <p><i>He warns you. You’re going to do it anyway. You both know that. Eyes
                  like TV ads that enslave you to debt. Voice like the fast food jingle talking
                  you into suicide by tiny bites. The wanting. Every happiness you already
                  have turns to bile. You smile. “Yes,” you say. “More,” you say. “Anything.”</i></p>
               <p>Whatever the Daeva pursue, they pursue
                  with a prodigious appetite. That pursuit is often
                  social, but can be physical or intellectual
                  just as easily. Regardless, it will require an
                  audience. The aloof, puzzle-solving genius,
                  who hungers for riddles, will need that genius
                  recognized. The Daeva thrive in the crush of
                  humanity. They are not so graceful in a vacuum.
                  Their damnation requires a feedback loop, more so
                  than the other clans.</p>
               <p>As with Attributes, so too with Skills. Take a
                  care when selecting Skill Specialities, as one of
                  these touches of brilliance is likely the thing that
                  attracted your character’s sire. The back-story of
                  that relationship can easily blossom from that
                  one trait. Social Skills are rarely the tertiary category, as Daeva keep in practice in dealing with the kine.
                  They rarely lose the Man to the Beast through isolation. They
                  are the vampires most likely to cultivate Empathy. However, they
                  have a tendency to pick up the worst habits of humanity. More
                  so than other Kindred, they understand the subtle nuances of
                  the pain their social predation causes. That’s just another road
                  to the Beast.</p>
               <p>Ask how much your character will rely on Majesty. If
                  he’s going to do it heavily, then you’ll want Presence and
                  Manipulation, as well as Empathy. Celerity requires no specific
                  Attribute or Skill choices, but effects like Vigor’s jumping ability
                  benefit from Strength.</p>
               <p>Many Daeva affect striking appearances, the better to attract
                  the eye. These birds of Hermes glory in their peacock splendor.
                  Unlike most other dead predators, they function best when
                  seen. Yet through their command of Majesty, a Daeva can make
                  any look work — plain clothes become glamorous — weather-
                  worn garb becomes grungy and hip. Some Daeva stop worrying
                  about their appearances, and somehow that not caring makes
                  them even more attractive. Some go so far as to purposefully
                  challenge themselves with clashing bits of clothing hastily
                  snatched from the thrift store, amping their supernatural auras,
                  and becoming beacons of incongruous Tyler Durden cool.
                  Regardless of dress, a practiced eye might be able to identify a
                  Daeva by the way she moves. They are always moving. Even the
                  most clumsy mortal might awaken to sinuous grace as a Serpent.</p>
               <p class="card p-1 bg-grey"><b>Clan Bane: The Wanton Curse.</b> You
                  taste the romance in all things, but none so

                  are your obsession, and that fixation grows
                  with every sip. Drink more than once, from
                  any mortal, and you risk becoming emotionally
                  dependent on your prey.</p>

               <h1 id="Gangrel">Gangrel</h1>
               <p><i>Wasn’t the howling. Weren’t the claws or magnesium eyes or the lizard
                  brain keening, “Run, run, run!” Was the change. Like them trashy drive-
                  in horrors, only on rewind. Monstrous bulk shrinking — snout flattening
                  — fangs dulling down to pearls — fur receding to a naked obscenity. The
                  smiling little girl walking towards you on filthy feet. That’s what did it.
                  Ten thousand beasts pressing out on her belly like it’s a theatre curtain
                  on opening night. That’s what emptied your bowels and sanity.</i></p>
               <p>All Gangrel are survivors. Those
                  who are not quickly change, or litter the
                  earth with their ash. But not all Gangrel
                  are alphas. Some saunter down the streets
                  as the dog with the biggest bite. Some creep
                  and hide as scavengers. Some move about
                  as shifting chameleons. Many Gangrel
                  go through several phases in the unholy
                  lifecycles of their Requiems.</p>
               <p>A Savage is molded by her environment
                  and situation. The stereotypical Gangrel
                  allots primary slots to her Physical Attributes
                  and Skills, with plenty of points of Stamina,
                  Survival, and Brawl. But there is room for
                  variation. A Savage who survives on all growl
                  and bluster might take Social Attributes as
                  primary, and load up on Intimidation. A clever
                  coyote of a Gangrel might survive through
                  sharp Mental Attributes and a lot
                  of Stealth and Larceny. Perhaps he
                  swims in political waters, latching
                  on to more powerful monsters
                  like a remora, flattering the fiends
                  using high scores in Manipulation and Persuasion. Some Gangrel quickly abandon their Humanity, to become better
                  predators. And some Gangrel practice human mimicry, down
                  to an art, to become better predators.</p>
               <p>If your character is going to make heavy use of Animalism,
                  you’ll want Manipulation and Animal Ken to start, adding
                  Presence and Intimidation as he matures.</p>
               <p>More than any other clan, the Gangrel’s Beast expresses
                  itself. This expression, through Protean, is unique from
                  Savage to Savage, and affords a player a spot of creativity.
                  What is your Beast like? Is it cold and reptilian? Is it an
                  aquatic predator like a shark or leopard seal? Is it at home
                  underground or in networks of alleys like a rat? Perhaps
                  it is more akin to a bat or bird of prey, comfortable when
                  looking down from great heights. It might rage like a wolf
                  or bear. It might have a mad hyena cackle. It might be a
                  chimera amalgam of creatures. Decide the flavor of your
                  Beast, and work with the Storyteller on how to best manifest
                  it through Protean. When not employing her shapeshifting
                  powers, what behaviors does your character betray that subtly
                  communicates this Beast?</p>
               <p class="card p-1 bg-grey"><b>Clan Bane: The Feral Curse.</b> The Beast lethargically coils
                  under the R-Complex of most Kindred. But you and the Beast
                  are as thick as thieves. It rises and rips out of your skin to protect
                  you from the bad, bad world. But it has a price. It’s harder to
                  resist the Beast’s call, harder still to remember why you should
                  even want to.</p>

               <h1 id="Mekhet">Mekhet</h1>
               <p><i>That shit-eating grin. The shit-heel prick. How’d he get into your game?
                  “Not playing the cards; I’m playing you,” he croons. He’s not wearing
                  shades, but you can’t see his eyes. Chuckle. “Always wearing shade,” he
                  says. Did you talk out loud? The fucker is playing the cards, because you
                  just did a bottom deal, a triple lift, and two moves that ain’t got names.
                  You know his hand. He’s already lost. Bastard’s not even looking at his
                  cards. He knows. He doesn’t say, “Fold.” Says something else. Says your
                  secret. The thing no one else knows. The thing you sit up at night praying
                  no one ever finds out. The table flips. Loud noises. Your poker buddies
                  beat you bloody. Through it all, you see his grin. He just fades away, and
                  the last thing floating in the tobacco smoke is that grin.</i></p>
               <p>The Mekhet see and are yet unseen. This is
                  endemic to their Vitae. A Shadow often has at
                  least a few dots of the Stealth Skill. Even a
                  cement-footed klutz in life finds that, after
                  the Mekhet Embrace, people say things
                  to him like, “Oh! I didn’t see you there.”
                  Likewise, Occult and Investigation are
                  common skills, as Mekhet tend to obsess
                  over uncovering secrets. Larceny can prove
                  useful too, as sometimes there are doors
                  and locks between a clever Shadow and
                  those delicious secrets.</p>
               <p>Mental Attributes and Skills are rarely
                  tertiary. Anyone can be Embraced
                  by a Mekhet, but those newly dead
                  minds find themselves hungry for
                  mental stimulation and consumed
                  by curiosity. Shadows compulsively
                  gravitate to certain manias and
                  expressions of an inner darkness.
                  These obsessions might manifest as
                  an interest in the occult, academia,
                  puzzle solving, prophecy, weird art,
                  poetry, symbolism, or other esoterica.</p>
               <p>A Shadow who wishes to hide in plain
                  sight with Obfuscate will benefit from Wits
                  and Larceny. A young Mekhet who wants to
                  use Auspex to sniff out his enemies’ secrets
                  will want Wits, Intelligence, and Empathy.</p>
               <p>The clan’s love of cyphers often makes its
                  members talented users of the Cacophony,
                  and they often have ratings in the Cacophony
                  Savvy Merit. More than one Mekhet has
                  found herself the center of an enigmatic cult
                  (and should take the appropriate Herd and
                  Retainers Merits).</p>
               <p>Appearance varies from Shadow to Shadow.
                  Some dress very professionally. Others play it
                  more obvious, wearing lots of black. Others
                  subconsciously dress more and more unremarkably,
                  until they are hard to notice even when not
                  employing supernatural stealth. Some Mekhet dress
                  extremely eccentrically, a silent dare for the bovine-
                  eyed mortals to see them. A weary vampire might let
                  her appearance go, not bothering with grooming or
                  changing clothes for a world to which she is invisible. Some Mekhet do not even bother wearing clothes anymore. As
                  a Mekhet suffers further disassociation from his identity, he may
                  go through rapid and drastic changes in personal appearance, or
                  even take on the likeness of his last victim.</p>

                  turning around or nary a peep, it won’t kill you. When did you lose your
                  shoes? The pavement turns to tongue meat, tasting your bleeding soles
                  with every step.</i></p>
               <p>A Nosferatu might begin play with any set of Attributes as
                  primary. All the more tragic if they were strongly social in life.
                  Most Haunts have high Composure ratings. They witness so
                  much horror in their Requiems that it becomes difficult to
                  unnerve them. More than a few Nosferatu develop high ratings
                  in Resolve, over time, as the isolation of the curse often makes
                  them self-reliant.</p>
               <p>Members of this clan usually have an affinity for the
                  Intimidation and Stealth Skills. This is a product of both their
                  supernatural natures, and which abilities they have to hone to
                  survive. As for Merits, Nosferatu often have ratings in Haven
                  (underground lairs), and benefit from having Retainers to deal
                  directly with the mortal world.</p>
               <p>A young Nosferatu’s use of the Nightmare Discipline benefits
                  most from Presence and Empathy, while the Discipline’s
                  capstone power favors Intimidation. Strength dots benefit from
                  the persistent effects of Vigor. Obfuscate suggests taking dots
                  in Wits and Larceny, though most powers don’t require rolls.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the most important consideration when creating a
                  Nosferatu character is the form his horrific curse takes. Players
                  have more creative latitude here than with the other clans.
                  Haunts are infected with a weirdness that warps their bodies
                  or the world around them.</p>
               <p>The curse can express itself as a series of physical deformities:
                  bulging eyes, empty sockets that still yet see, corpselike skin,
                  grotesquely long fingers, withered limbs that can somehow
                  upend a car, hideously large mouth, mouths in places they
                  should not be, vestigial limbs, skin that hangs like wet clay,
                  scales, malformed skull, excreted fluids, a miasma of cloying
                  dust, a stench. Players can find a treasure trove of inspiration
                  by Googling images of subterranean or deep sea fauna.</p>
               <p>The curse can express itself in ways stranger still: an
                  animate shadow that moves when the Nosferatu is still; a
                  shadow belonging to someone else (her last victim?); maggots manifesting in any place he lingers; objects (including her
                  clothing) rotting away at her prolonged touch; strange twittering
                  and giggles that manifest about him; her mouth never moving
                  when she speaks; his voice always seeming to come from a few
                  feet away from his head; lights flickering low in her presence.
                  Perhaps the viewer’s eyes always slide off the Haunt’s features,
                  and no one remembers what it was that was so wrong about him.</p>
               <p class="card p-1 bg-grey"><b>Clan Bane: The Lonely Curse.</b>You are an avatar of disgust.
                  Dread and discomfort oozes from you, scabbing everything over
                  in the putrid film of your rotting soul’s exhaust. Your body is
                  warped, or the world around you warps. This could manifest
                  in ways grotesque or subtle. Fear and all its gibbering siblings
                  come easy for you. Most other forms of social communion do
                  not. Yours is a lonely Requiem.</p>

               <h1 id="Ventrue">Ventrue</h1>
               <p><i>“Let’s make this interesting,” she says. She tells you all the heinous
                  things you are about to do. You laugh in her face. Ridiculous. Then,
                  one by one, all of your limbs betray you. You see everything. You see it
                  all through the socket windows of your Judas body. You try, and fail, to
                  scream through the frozen smile fracturing your face.</i></p>
               <p>Domination comes in many flavors. A Ventrue might
                  achieve it through Physical, Mental, or Social Attributes
                  and Skills. Players may pick any category as their
                  character’s primary. Choose any of the three, and then
                  decide how that works as your path to power. Does your
                  Ventrue character take control through calculated
                  displays of brawn? Perhaps your Lord rules
                  out in the open with her presence, or by
                  pulling the strings from the shadows as
                  an ingenious mastermind. The Ventrue
                  approve of excellence in all of its forms.
                  They give the Embrace to members
                  of old-money families and self-made
                  successes alike. They also Embrace
                  professionals at the tops of their
                  respective fields.</p>
               <p>The signature Lordly Discipline
                  of Dominate suggests Intelligence,
                  Expression, and Subterfuge. A young
                  vampire styling herself a Lord over beasts
                  as well as people with Animalism will want
                  Manipulation and Animal Ken to start.</p>
               <p>Breeding matters to the Lords. The Dynasty
                  Membership Merit becomes important.
                  Players can work with the Storyteller to create
                  a memorable dead family to give the weight
                  of history and long shadows to cast over the
                  character. Merits such as Contacts, Status, and
                  Resources are common to the clan. These may
                  have been acquired in life or after. Like any
                  other vampire, the Ventrue might Embrace
                  a prince or a pauper, but the Blood has an
                  illimitable inertia that pushes that vampire
                  towards influence, no matter how humble
                  his origins.</p>
               <p>Appearance varies widely amongst the
                  Lords. Many dress for success in high-
                  contrasting colors and power angles. Those
                  who wore uniforms in life often carry them
                  over into death, deriving what authority
                  the garments carry. For some Ventrue, the
                  first declaration of power is the physical
                  appearance that others first see. The
                  first impression is vital. However, there
                  are other Ventrue who hide their power
                  behind ordinary, even homely appearances.
                  They rule behind anonymity. They turn their vanities inward and are able to subsist entirely on the
                  self-satisfaction squeezed from the smiles they give themselves
                  in private.</p>

                  When people are puppets for your will and buildings are play

                  It is so very easy for you to become detached from those people,
