               <h2 id="Animalism">Animalism</h2>
               <p>A vampire’s Beast is not just a facet of her predatory nature,
                  but a predator in and of itself — and it’s at the top of the food
                  chain. A vampire can slip the leash of her Beast just a little
                  to overpower weaker animals, forcing her will on them. Most
                  Animalism powers affect predators and scavenging animals. In
                  a city, the Kindred can call on feral cats and dogs, pigeons and
                  crows, foxes, and more rats than anyone wants to think about.
                  Rural vampires can summon bats, wolves, mountain lions, and
                  even bears — any animal that feasts on the flesh of another.</p>
               <h3 id="FeralWhispers">Feral Whispers •</h3>
               <p>The vampire makes themself understood by one or more animals that can see and hear them. 
                  They can ask questions of a creature and it must respond as best it can, 
                  and with a further slight nudge, they can compel it to obey.</p>
               <p>The vampire talks to the animal, either using human words
                  or by making animal sounds.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> None</p>
               <p><b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism</p>
               <p><b>Action:</b> Instant</p>
               <p><b>Duration:</b> Scene, command can persist up to a night.</p>
               <h4>Roll Results</h4>
               <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The animal misunderstands the vampire’s
                  command, giving false information when the vampire asks, or
                  obeying a twisted version of the vampire’s command.</p>
               <p><b>Failure:</b> The animals fear the Beast, fleeing from a superior
                  predator.</p>
               <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire can communicate with an animal,
                  asking it what it has perceived. Most animals can remember
                  what has happened over the last night. Animals relate what they
                  have encountered through the lens of their own perceptions —
                  dogs answer in terms of smell and hearing, while birds relate
                  what they could see. The vampire can also give the victim a
                  simple command, equivalent to what the animal could do on
                  its own, such as “attack him,” “follow her then return here,”
                  “chew through these cables.” The command doesn’t normally
                  persist for more than a night, but the vampire can add simple
                  contingencies such as forcing the beast to go to ground if
                  noticed, or to return once the command is complete.</p>
               <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> The animal is exceptionally obedient to the
                  vampire, improvising to follow the spirit of the Kindred’s command.</p>
               <h3 id="RaiseTheFamiliar">Raise the Familiar ••</h3>
               <p>True beasts cannot be Embraced. They have never had the
                  necessary Humanity. With this power, though, the vampire
                  can complete the process halfway. By feeding a drained animal
                  some vitae, a vampire can infuse it with a fragment of the
                  kindred’s twilight life. It looks as it did when it died, though
                  if appropriate, it might gain retractable fangs like a vampire.
                  But the fangs are a lie — its true tragedy is that it cannot
                  transubstantiate blood into Vitae. If it was wounded in death,
                  it retains signs of the injuries, but its body functions fully. A
                  coyote crushed by an SUV has a tire track running across it
                  but no crushed bones, and a crow with a busted wing has bone
                  jutting out of the wound but can still fly.</p>
               <p>It doesn’t act like a normal animal — it doesn’t hunt for
                  food, nor is it spooked by loud noises. It sleeps throughout the
                  day, but becomes active at night. A human observing such an
                  animal might be able to tell something’s wrong, but only the
                  most grievous wounds usually make them take the time to look.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> 1 vitae, fed to the corpse</p>
               <p><b>Action:</b> Instant</p>
               <p><b>Duration:</b> (Blood Potency * animal’s Stamina) nights</p>
               <p>The vampire feeds one point of Vitae to the animal’s corpse.
                  The animal returns to a semblance of life for a number of
                  nights equal to (Blood Potency * animal’s Stamina). Once the beast has been raised, 
                  a vampire can feed it more Vitae; each point ensures the animal’s continued existence as though the vampire
                  had just raised it.</p>
               <p>The raised creature gains a semblance of intelligence and
                  a certain low cunning, enough to follow complex orders that
                  most animals could not understand, and to interpret the spirit
                  of commands rather than the letter. Treat the familiar as having
                  one dot of Intelligence.</p>
               <p>Infused with vitae, the familiar takes bashing damage from
                  attacks like a vampire, and does not fall unconscious or bleed
                  out. The animal does not decompose.</p>
               <h3 id="SummonTheHunt">Summon the Hunt •••</h3>
               <p>The vampire's vitae becomes irresistible to other predators and scavenging beasts.
                  Wherever they spill their blood — on the ground, over an object, or
                  even splashing it on another person — the animals they calls will try
                  to consume it. This effect only loses potency once the summoned
                  animals destroy the bloodied target or once the sun rises, at
                  which point the vitae burns away as though it were never present.
                  The vampire can focus the Beast’s call on one kind of creature, for example
                  summoning just birds or rats. Prey animals in the affected area
                  rightly shy away, afraid of the power of a vampire’s Beast.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> 2 vitae, spilled upon the target</p>
               <p><b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism</p>
               <p><b>Action:</b> Instant</p>
               <p><b>Duration:</b> One night, or until the item marked with blood
               is destroyed.</p>
               <h4>Roll Results</h4>
               <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The animals follow the Beast’s call, but
               lash out against the vampire in fear.</p>
               <p><b>Failure:</b> Animals within the Discipline’s range feel their
               normal fear of the Kindred and stay well away.</p>
               <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire chooses when spilling the vitae whether
                  to summon all predators and scavengers, or whether to restrict
                  the call to a swarm of one kind of animal. 
                  Once they taste the spilled Vitae, the vampire can
                  imprint a command as though they had used Feral Whispers
                  on the animal. All animals receive the same command, but it
                  persists even while the vampire slumbers; the animals follow
                  the command for one night per success.</p>
               <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> Animals that taste the vampire’s blood
                  follow the command with single-minded zeal. They do not stop
                  to eat or sleep, deriving sustenance from the taste of vitae alone.</p>
               <h3 id="FeralInfection">Feral Infection ••••</h3>
               <p>The vampire floods the area with a predatory aura, infecting
                  everything around her with the ravings of her Beast. The scent
                  of her blood inspires rage in animals, and can drive men mad,
                  especially those who have recently touched her blood. Other
                  Kindred witnessing the effects of Feral Infection recognize the
                  Beast unchained, likening the victims’ actions to their own
                  moments of frenzy. The vampire using this Discipline can exert
                  a measure of control over her victims’ madness, focusing her
                  own Beast against some victim she wants to crush, or a goal
                  she wants to conquer.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> 2 Vitae</p>
               <p><b>Requirement:</b> Spill 1 Vitae upon the ground (included in
               cost).</p>
               <p><b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Intimidation + Animalism</p>
               <p><b>Action:</b> Instant</p>
               <p><b>Duration:</b> Scene</p>
               <h4>Roll Results</h4>
               <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The vampire loses hold of her Beast, and
               it smashes past her. She is provoked to frenzy, though with a
               –2 die modifier on the roll to resist.</p>
               <p><b>Failure:</b> Affected animals display odd behavior — chasing
               their tails, or attacking their own limbs — but nothing drives
               them into a rage.</p>
               <p><b>Success:</b> Any animal that can smell the vampire’s blood
               enters a state of feral rage. It lashes out, attacking the nearest
               victim without a thought for its own safety. Once the victim
               is unconscious or dead, the animal feeds on his flesh. If the
               vampire wishes, she can direct the mob of frenzied creatures
               towards a single target or goal. She can’t give complex
               instructions or a direct command, but can point out targets to
               attack or the direction to move in.</p>
               <p>Humans and supernatural creatures must make a reflexive
               (Resolve + Composure – vampire’s successes) roll to resist the
               vampire’s predatory Aura. If the victim has touched or imbibed
               the vampire’s blood within the last night, they suffer a –3
               die penalty. A failed roll puts the victim under the vampire’s
               command. Vampires and werewolves frenzy, their victims
               dictated by the Kindred who provoked them. Humans and
               other supernatural creatures fall into an atavistic state where
               they must attack the target, or move towards it if they can’t
               reach it. If the vampire does not set a command, her victims
               turn upon one another. A supernatural creature can spend a
               point of Willpower to ignore the vampire’s commands, though
               she remains frenzied.</p>
               <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> Unleashing her Beast sates it
               temporarily. The vampire gains the Sated Condition (p. 305).</p>
               <h3 id="LordOfTheLand">Lord of the Land •••••</h3>
               <p>The vampire marks her territory with Vitae, in much the
               same way that animals use urine or feces. She must encircle her
               territory in a ring of Vitae, claiming it as her own — assuming she has driven off any prior residents. When encircling the territory,
               she must walk the whole border. Some Kindred open wounds
               on their hands and arms and walk at a stately pace, dripping
               a slow stream of thick blood behind them. Others run wild,
               smearing blood and bodily fluids on surfaces like a feral beast.</p>
               <p>Once she has established her territory, the vampire is privy to
               everything that happens within it. She can command animals,
               summon or banish people, and provoke other vampires to leave
               her lair. Most vampires establish their territory in small places,
               like a brownstone or small public garden. A powerful vampire
               might claim a whole public park or castle, but he must make
               sure that nothing interrupts his claim — more than one vampire
               has discovered that his territory is already claimed by an angry
               pack of werewolves halfway through claiming it.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> 3-9 Vitae and 1 Willpower</p>
               <p><b>Requirement:</b> The vampire must walk a circuit around his new
               territory while marking it with Vitae. Three Vitae is enough to
               secure a small house or garden, six can secure a city block, while
               nine is enough to claim a castle. She must make sure that the
               area contains no other vampires; many Kindred prefer to evict
               all supernatural denizens. While the Discipline will still function
               if her territory contains werewolves or other monsters, they will
               suffer the effects — and will deduce that the vampire is to blame.</p>
               <p><b>Action:</b> Instant</p>
               <p><b>Duration:</b> One week per dot of Blood Potency, longer if the
               vampire remains in his territory.</p>
               <p>The vampire marks her territory. It remains empowered for at
               least one week per dot of Blood Potency, though the effects of
               this Discipline only end when the vampire leaves her territory
               after the duration. Rumors speak of ancient vampires lying in
               torpor whose territories remain active to this day.</p>
               <p>A vampire’s territory scares off most creatures. Animals
               and wild beasts won’t enter, and will fight to escape if forced
               inside, unless otherwise affected by the vampire’s powers.
               Humans and supernatural creatures, including other vampires,
               must succeed at a reflexive Composure + Blood Potency roll
               to enter — or to stay in the area once it is created. Unless they
               roll an exceptional success, the feeling of overwhelming dread
               inflicts a –3 die penalty on all actions. For Kindred, simply
               being in another vampire’s territory is provocation to frenzy,
               and rolls to resist suffer a –2 die penalty. If a vampire explicitly
               invites someone into his territory — or uses Feral Whispers or
               Summon the Hunt in the case of animals — they do not suffer
               these penalties. Ghoul animals are also exempt.</p>
               <p>When the vampire is within her territory, she can feel when a
               person or animal crosses into her territory; if an invader is a vampire,
               she knows his general Blood Potency. She always has a rough idea of
               where everyone is within her domain, and only supernatural means
               such as Disciplines can cut through her awareness — triggering a
               Clash of Wills. As the undisputed master of her territory, a frenzying
               creature cannot attack the vampire, nor may they spend Willpower
               to resist her commands delivered through Feral Infection. Any
               commands given by Feral Whispers last indefinitely, or until the animal leaves the vampire’s territory. Finally, the vampire can snatch
               the senses of any animal she has raised with Raise the Familiar within
               her territory, and use that animal to deliver commands using Feral
               Whispers to other creatures.</p>

               finding points of weakness and hidden gems that the vampire
               can exploit to his advantage. Auspex is an internal Discipline,
               revealing information to the Kindred through visions that range
               from the direct to the hallucinatory. Other vampires have no
               way to know when someone is using Auspex to discover their
               secrets, and for that reason many Mekhet feel the stares and
               whispered barbs of other vampires who worry what secrets the

               room. The Beast is sensitive to things that other people cannot
               normally perceive; using this Discipline can pierce Obfuscate

               shine on the victim. The sound of dogs barking.</i></li>
               What is this person’s Vice/Requiem? The sound of conspiratorial
               whispers. The smell of drugs wafting off a junkie.
               <li>What is one of this person’s psychological vulnerabilities? <i>A
               sudden feeling of incredible depression. Shifting walls and colors as
               if in a hallucination.</i></li>
               <li>Is this person a diablerist? <i>The smell of brimstone and clotted
               blood. Thick black blood dripping off the victim’s chin.</i></li>
               <li>Is this person being controlled by someone else? <i>Marionette
               strings leading from the victim’s limbs up to the ceiling. A whispered
               voice that tells the victim what to do as she acts.</i></li>
               <li>Is this person a supernatural creature — and if I have seen
               them before, what is she? <i>The taste of torn flesh. The glowing
               halo of a mage’s nimbus.</i></li>
               <li>Who here does this person want to hurt most? <i>A bloody dagger

               own thoughts, he can project ideas or memories into the victim’s
               mind. With a little practice, the vampire can communicate
               without words, or project full memories to overwhelm the
               victim’s senses. He can even stimulate memories by thinking of
               a time, place, or emotion that causes the victim to remember —
               even if the victim had blocked it out or had it removed by magic.</p>

               or depositing a mental image or memory.</p>
               <p>By focusing, the vampire can drag up a full memory from the

               Wills). He experiences all of the memory in an instant, with all
               five senses. If he chooses to transmit that memory to the victim,
               he can inflict a Condition like Guilty, Inspired, or Shaken as
               appropriate (p. 302 and p. 305). Uncovering further memories
               costs 1 Vitae per memory.</p>

               substance to it, but still in the world and noticeable only by other

               speeds, traveling to any point within the moon’s orbit — an area
               that some Kindred call the “lunar sphere.” While his senses

               <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire’s senses part from his body, and can
               travel the world. Multiply the vampire’s Speed by his (Auspex +
               Blood Potency). The vampire is not bound by gravity, and can
               travel through physical obstacles and even into the ground.
               He cannot interact with the physical world in any way when
               separate from his body. He can see and hear as well as he can
               normally, but cannot use Disciplines. The vampire’s body lies in
               a torpor-like state, and he is unaware of anything that happens
               to it — though if someone kills his body or drives him to torpor,
               his mind jumps back to his body. Apart from that, the vampire
               must move his astral form back to his body to awaken. Every
               sunrise that the vampire remains separate from his body he loses
               a dot of Blood Potency — and suffers Final Death if his Blood
               Potency reaches 0. He regains any lost dots upon returning to
               his body. He must still spend a point of Vitae at the beginning
               of each night. Some vampires speak of strange magic that can
               prevent a vampire from returning to his body, or of his body
               walking around unbidden, with yellow eyes the only sign that
               something might be wrong.</p>
               <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> The vampire’s senses slip away easily,
               and he is left with a memory of where his body is. He can
               reflexively spend a point of Vitae to instantly return to his
               body — or to the edge of any mystic boundary that prevents
               him from returning.</p>

               <p><b>Persistent:</b> Add the vampire’s dots in Celerity to her Defense,
               or to her Dodge roll when defending actively. If a Firearms attack
               denies her normal Defense, the attacker still takes a penalty on
               his attack equal to the vampire’s dots in Celerity. A character
               must still be aware of incoming attacks to defend against them.</p>
               If she is restrained, slumbering, or otherwise unable to respond, Celerity offers no advantage.
               <p><b>Active:</b> By spending Vitae Celerity allows for bursts of speed
               faster than the eye can perceive. For each point of Vitae spent
               choose one effect from the following list. A vampire may spend
               additional Vitae to invoke multiple effects simultaneously, but
               no effect of Celerity may be used more than once per turn.</p>
               <ul><li>Immediately move to the head of the Initiative queue.
               This boost in Initiative lasts only one turn, after which all
               combatants return to acting in their rolled order. If multiple
               vampires attempt to jump ahead simultaneously they enter a
               Clash of Wills (p. 125), the winner acts first.</li>
               <li>Interrupt the action of another character with a brief action of
               her own. This could be an attack, making it possible to disable an
               opponent in mid-action. It may be movement, avoiding harm by
               shifting out of reach. Or it could be any other instant action, like
               activating a Discipline or dodging. However, the vampire is still
               limited to one instant action. She cannot use Celerity to make two
               attacks, or an attack followed by another instant action. Likewise she
               cannot move further in a single turn than her Speed would allow.
               The decision to interrupt is made after another character’s action is
               declared, but before it actually occurs (before dice are rolled). Once
               interrupted, the other character must continue his declared action,
               if it’s still possible. If the action is no longer possible, he takes no
               action. Alternatively, that character’s player may declare his action a
               dramatic failure and take a Beat. Celerity cannot interrupt reflexive
               actions or actions of which the character was unaware. Finally, using
               Celerity in this way is exhausting; a vampire may only interrupt as
               many actions in a scene as she has dots in Celerity.</li>
               <li>Multiply her speed by her dots in Celerity plus one. Moving
               in this way is sudden, jarring, the vampire appears to shift from
               point to point without crossing the space in-between. She may
               use this to briefly avoid detection or launch surprise attacks.</li></ul>

               <p>The Beast demands obedience from lesser creatures. It slips
               into the Kindred’s voice, modulating his tone and his words to
               express absolute authority. It progresses from the simple barked
               commands of a drill sergeant to creating false memories of
               whatever the vampire desires — or letting her steal her victim’s

               <p>All a vampire has to do is meet her victim’s eye to catch him
               in her thrall. Her control isn’t obvious; she just asks him to do
               something and her victim acquiesces. He could unlock a door,
               pass her a gun — or forget ever meeting her. Some cruel vampires
               mesmerize passers-by just to take the rap for their crimes.</p>

               <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The victim sees through the vampire’s
               attempt to control his mind; emboldened, he gains the Steadfast
               Condition (p. 306).</p>
               <p><b>Failure:</b> The vampire’s victim proves stronger-willed than
               she’d thought.</p>
               <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire holds her victim’s gaze for just a second,
               but it’s enough to inflict the Mesmerized Condition (p. 305).</p>
               <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> The vampire’s control flows over the
               victim’s brain like water. They want to do whatever the vampire
               says. The vampire can issue a command in the same action as
               mesmerizing the victim.</p>
               <p>Once she has inflicted the Mesmerized Condition, the
               vampire can command the victim as an instant action. Her
               commands can’t be longer than three or four words, and she
               has to be direct — her control doesn’t extend to issuing vague
               commands. “Follow me,” “Shoot your husband,” and “Repeat
               after me…” are all suitable commands, while “Forget,” “Submit,”
               and “Do my bidding” have too much room for interpretation.
               She can even mess with the victim’s memory, making one
               statement about the current scene that victim will remember
               as truth. While she can still only use simple and unambiguous
               commands, she can pack a lot of changes into four words: “You
               killed that man” and “I was not here” combine to frame the
               victim for murder.</p>
               <h3 id="IronEdict">Iron Edict ••</h3>
               <p>Once she’s got a hotline into her victim’s mind, the vampire
               can take some time to play with his thoughts and memories.
               While it takes more of her power to relay complex commands,
               she goes from jerking her victim’s strings to controlling him like
               a puppeteer, making his every movement dance to her tune.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> 1 Vitae; none if victim is in Vinculum with the vampire</p>
               <p><b>Requirement:</b> The vampire must have inflicted the Mesmerized Condition on the victim</p>
               <p><b>Action:</b> Instant</p>
               <p>The vampire can issue a longer command to a Mesmerized
               victim. This edict can be up to three sentences long, and can
               include a successive series of actions. The command takes two
               turns per sentence to convey. As with Mesmerize, the vampire’s
               control doesn’t extend to commands that rely on the victim’s
               interpretation. The victim takes the Dominated Condition (p.
               302) and will follow the vampire’s commands as soon as she
               finishes speaking them. He continues to follow the order until
               he has completed his task, or the sun rises. Many Kindred use
               Iron Edict to issue a simple command, such as “Obey my direct
               instructions when I give them to you,” which effectively gives
               them control over the minion until the sun comes up — though
               it doesn’t extend the duration of the Mesmerized Condition.</p>
               <h3 id="EntombedCommand">Entombed Command •••</h3>
               <p>The vampire has enough control over her meat-puppet to
               implant a subconscious trigger, a specific set of conditions that
               will turn him into her slave when he encounters them. She can
               force her victim into a suggestible state when he points a gun at
               her, make him transfer all of his money into her account when
               he hears Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, or only allow him to
               remember his son when he smells lilacs.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> None; other Dominate powers may cost Vitae.</p>
               <p><b>Dice Pool:</b> Intelligence + Subterfuge + Dominate – victim’s Resolve</p>
               <p><b>Requirement:</b> The vampire must have inf licted the Mesmerized Condition on the victim</p>

               <p><b>Duration:</b> One week per success, or one month per success (see below).</p>
               <h4>Roll Results</h4>
               <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The vampire’s attempt to set up a trigger
               backfires. The victim loses his Mesmerized Condition. For the
               next week, when he encounters one trigger that the vampire
               attempted to set he instead gains the Steadfast Condition (p. 306).
               Failure: The attempt to set triggers in the victim’s mind
               doesn’t take. Is he fighting back, or is there another reason?</p>
               <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire can implant a number of subconscious
               triggers equal to the number of successes rolled to trigger
               specific effects of other Dominate powers. She must pay any
               Vitae cost for these powers as normal. These triggers remain
               in place for one week per success, or one month per success if
               the victim is in any stage of Vinculum towards the vampire.
               During that time, the effects of the trigger emerge each time
               the victim encounters the stimulus.</p>
               <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> The vampire’s commands slip into the
               victim’s subconscious with ease. Reduce the Vitae cost by one
               when implanting Iron Edict and The Lying Mind.</p>
               <p>Each trigger is a specific event or sensory stimulus that causes
               the linked effect to emerge. The vampire must pay any Vitae
               cost for other Dominate powers, but only need do so once to
               attach that power to any number of triggers. Using Iron Edict
               in conjunction with Entombed Command to force a man
               to show up at a nightclub when he argues with his wife, and
               making him fill a USB stick with sensitive information from
               his workplace all costs only one point of Vitae. Describing both
               the trigger and its specific effect on the victim takes about two
               turns per trigger.</p>
               <p>Other Dominate abilities work as follows when channeled
               through Entombed Command:</p>
               <ul><li><b>Mesmerize:</b> The victim gains the Mesmerized Condition
               when he encounters the trigger. If the vampire isn’t present
               to capitalize on his state, the effects soon fade.</li>
               <li><b>Iron Edict:</b> When the victim encounters the trigger, he
               immediately gains a Dominated Condition relating to the
               imprinted command. As he is entirely under the vampire’s
               sway when Dominated, he does not encounter other triggers
               until he resolves the Condition.</li>
               <li><b>The Lying Mind:</b> The trigger serves as a switch for memory
               alteration. Encountering it once causes a memory to emerge
               (or to vanish), while encountering it again reverses the change.</li></ul>
               <h3 id="TheLyingMind">The Lying Mind ••••</h3>
               <p>A mistress of Dominate can dance through her victim’s
               memories, sculpting them to her whims. He might not remember
               his family — or she might force him to remember the tragic death
               of a son who never existed. She can subtly alter his memories,
               replacing his wife’s face with her own, or moving his memory of
               a vacation from Paris to London. Beyond necessary generalities,
               this does not allow the vampire to read the original memories.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> 2 Vitae</p>
               <p><b>Requirement:</b> The vampire must have inf licted the
               Mesmerized Condition on the victim; the victim must consume
               or be anointed by 1 Vitae (included in cost).</p>
               <p><b>Action:</b> Instant</p>
               <p><b>Duration:</b> Permanent</p>
               <p>While he remains Mesmerized, the vampire can spin her victim’s
               memories like cotton candy, stretching far back into childhood. She
               must either feed him some of her Vitae or drip it onto his forehead.
               She can create memories of events from nothing, erase memories
               of an event or person, or change the people, events, and location of
               existing memories to serve her purpose. As part of this alteration, she
               inflicts a persistent Condition on the victim. If she deletes a broad
               swath of memories, the victim receives the Amnesia Condition (p.
               301), otherwise he takes the False Memories Condition (p. 303).</p>
               <p>The vampire has to speak with her victim, describing the
               changes she wants to make to his memories. Crude alterations
               — deleting a swathe of his past, or replacing his wife’s face
               with the vampire’s in all his memories — take about a minute
               to describe, but more detailed changes can take quite a bit
               longer. When changing memories or creating new ones, the
               vampire can create the factual content of the memory, but
               the victim’s thoughts and feelings remain out of her control.
               She can create an environment that makes him predisposed
               to certain reactions, but she can’t force him to love a son she’s
               just invented. The vampire’s changes are permanent, unless she
               used Entombed Command to only reveal them on a trigger.</p>
               <h3 id="Possession">Possession •••••</h3>
               <p>Controlling a victim’s memories and actions is one thing, but
               for some vampires the truest expression of control comes from
               suppressing the victim’s will entirely, taking complete control of
               his body. The vampire moves her mind into the victim, using
               his body instead of her own.</p>
               <p><b>Cost:</b> 1 Vitae and 1 Willpower</p>

               <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The victim’s mind will not be bound to
               the vampire’s control. He immediately resolves the Mesmerized
               Condition and regains a point of Willpower.</p>
               <p><b>Failure:</b> The vampire cannot take total control of her victim
               just yet.</p>
               <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire takes over her victim’s body for one night
               per success. While in this new body, she uses her victim’s Physical
               Attributes and Skills in place of her own, and gains any Physical
               or Combat Merits that the victim possessed. She can stay awake
               during the day by spending a point of Willpower at dawn and takes
               no damage from sunlight — if she does not spend Willpower, she
               returns to her body. Each night, she must spend a point of Vitae
               as normal. She cannot use Disciplines or Blood Sorcery when
               possessing someone else, nor can she access any supernatural powers
               her victim may possess, but she otherwise controls his body totally.
               If she attempts to kill herself the victim may roll Resolve + Blood
               Potency as a reflexive action, on a success he evicts the vampire from
               his consciousness. Possessing a victim removes the Mesmerized and
               Dominated Conditions, and the vampire is not subject to any triggers
               set on the victim by Entombed Command while she remains in
               control. Once she leaves the victim’s body, those triggers affect him
               as normal. While she commands the victim’s body, the vampire’s
               own form lies in a torpor-like state awaiting her return; if she remains
               in the victim’s body for so long that her body slips into torpor, she
               immediately snaps back into her body.</p>
               <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> The vampire slips into the victim’s body with
               ease, and leaves her jaunt in another body with renewed purpose.
               Upon leaving the victim’s body, she regains a point of Willpower.</p>

                  the vampire’s important, like a billionaire playboy or a movie
                  star. He could be wearing tattered clothes, with open wounds

                  if he’s just beaten another man to death or waved a gun in a
                  crowded nightclub. Given a chance, he can talk his way out of
                  minor criminal offenses and almost any social faux pas.</p>
                  <p>As the center of attention, he adds his Majesty dots to any

                  only applies when talking to people normally, not to other uses of

                  dots from any Wits + Composure rolls to notice anything other
                  than the vampire. With a word, he can summon anyone in the
                  room to his side — not by any mystical compulsion, but by making
                  her aware that he wants her to approach. Another vampire can
                  fortify herself against Awe with her predatory aura (see Lashing
                  Out, p. 92). If she succeeds, she is unaffected by Awe.</p>

                  that he’s already Awed, sometimes speaking quietly is the best
                  way to get attention. With little more than a soft voice and a
                  knowing look, the vampire brings someone new into the fold
                  and becomes her trusted confidant.</p>
                  <p><b>Cost:</b> None</p>
                  <p><b>Requirement:</b> The vampire must use Awe on the victim.</p>
                  <p><b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Empathy + Majesty vs. Resolve + Blood Potency</p>
                  <p><b>Action:</b> Contested; resistance is reflexive</p>
                  <h4>Roll Results</h4>
                  <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The vampire slips up, letting some of what
                  he wants the victim to feel leak back into himself. He’s affected
                  by the Swooning Condition (p. 306) for the victim.</p>
                  <p><b>Failure:</b> The victim doesn’t feel that she’s worthy of joining
                  the vampire’s inner circle just yet.</p>
                  <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire successfully charms his victim. She
                  gains the Charmed Condition (p. 301).</p>
                  <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> It’s incredibly hard to resist the force
                  of the vampire’s personality. The victim’s Charmed Condition
                  lasts for nights, rather than hours.</p>
                  <h3 id="GreenEyes">Green Eyes •••</h3>
                  <p>To a victim of this level of Majesty, the vampire’s
                  attention feels so good that it’s addictive. His inner
                  circle craves his attention like a crackhead craves
                  a rock or a writer needs coffee. That craving first
                  becomes desperation and then jealousy as other
                  people attract the vampire’s gaze, if only for a
                  minute.</p>
                  <p><b>Cost:</b> 1 Vitae</p>
                  <p><b>Requirement:</b> The vampire must have inflicted the Charmed or Enthralled Condition on the target.</p>
                  <p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive</p>
                  <p><b>Duration:</b> Scene</p>
                  <p>His victim is now thoroughly obsessed with
                  the vampire, and he can play with her feelings
                  and desires like they were a cheap harmonica.
                  With Green Eyes, he can shift the emotional
                  state of anyone he’s Charmed, sending them
                  into a violent rage (or even a frenzy, in the case
                  of some supernatural creatures) or making them
                  so depressed that they feel hollow without him.
                  Each shift costs him a point of Vitae, but he can
                  instill the same emotion in any number of victims
                  at once.</p>
                  <p>The vampire can ask one of his Charmed
                  minions to do something in such a way that they
                  feel an obsessive need to accomplish it. He could
                  ask them to kill someone, to give him money, or
                  to perform debased and degrading acts for his
                  amusement. A Charmed victim will do whatever
                  he wants within reason — if the request would lead
                  to the victim taking lethal damage or hitting a
                  breaking point, the victim will save her own skin.
                  She resolves the Charmed Condition immediately.
                  An Enthralled victim is far more dangerous —
                  she won’t commit suicide for the vampire, but
                  anything else is fair game. If his victim would hit
                  a breaking point, she doesn’t notice (and doesn’t
                  roll for experiencing the breaking point) until the
                  Enthralled Condition expires.</p>
                  <h3 id="Loyalty">Loyalty ••••</h3>
                  <p>Among his inner circle, the vampire praises
                  some more than others, bringing them even
                  closer to him. With a few words he can inflame
                  their love for him. Beyond jealousy and obsession
                  comes complete loyalty. A victim will do absolutely
                  anything for him — and just thinking about
                  crossing the vampire is traumatic. She ignores
                  her other friends and her family. Her vampire is
                  all that matters.</p>
                  <p><b>Cost:</b> 2 Vitae</p>
                  <p><b>Requirement:</b> The vampire must have inflicted the Charmed Condition on the target.</p>
                  <p><b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Empathy + Majesty vs. Resolve + Blood Potency</p>
                  <p><b>Action:</b> Contested; resistance is reflexive</p>
                  <h4>Roll Results</h4>
                  <p><b>Dramatic Failure:</b> Something sets the victim on edge, some
                  discordant note forces her to rethink her affection for the
                  vampire. She immediately resolves the Charmed Condition.</p>
                  <p><b>Failure:</b> Though the victim remains devoted to the vampire,
                  her loyalty does not flare into fanaticism.</p>
                  <p><b>Success:</b> The vampire inspires burning loyalty in the victim.
                  She’d do anything for him, giving up her blood or organs —
                  or taking a bullet for him. The victim gains the Enthralled
                  Condition.</p>
                  <p><b>Exceptional Success:</b> The Enthralled Condition lasts for one
                  week per dot of Blood Potency.</p>
                  <h3 id="Idol">Idol •••••</h3>
                  <p>More than just a celebrity, a vampire who can play with
                  people’s desires becomes a king or a star, the kind of person
                  who wouldn’t ever be so crass as to demand people’s loyalty.
                  People around him give it willingly, pledging to do whatever
                  he wants if he’ll only notice them, look at them, or smile in
                  their direction.</p>
                  <p><b>Cost:</b> 2 Vitae and 1 Willpower</p>
                  <p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive</p>
                     <p><b>Duration:</b> Scene</p>
                  <p>Idol enhances Awe’s aura of superiority to divine (or
                  blasphemous) levels. The vampire can wait until she’s established
                  Awe and then enhance it, or pay the price to immediately
                  establish her superiority over everyone else in the room.
                  Anyone affected by the vampire’s Awe must make a reflexive
                  roll of Resolve + Blood Potency minus the vampire’s Majesty
                  dots in order to take an action that could harm or embarrass
                  the vampire in any way. Unless they succeed, they can’t so much
                  as crack a joke at his expense.</p>
                  <p>If the vampire has inflicted the Charmed Condition on
                  anyone in his presence, she must make a reflexive Resolve +
                  Blood Potency – Majesty dots roll when the vampire activates
                  Idol. If she fails, she acquires the Enthralled Condition for the
                  remainder of the scene. People who the vampire has already
                  Enthralled cannot spend Willpower to act against him.</p>

                  <p>The Beast doesn’t need fear. Fear is rational, understandable
                  — a reaction to a presented stimulus. Any idiot can make
                  people fear him. Nightmare indulges the Beast’s desire to cause
