      </ol></div>
      <div>
        <h2>1. Concept</h2>
        <p>At this first stage, come up with a rough idea of who you want
          to play. Who was she in life? What kind of vampire is she? Don’t
          worry too much about things like clan and covenant at this
          step. Instead, try to filter down the idea of your character into
          a single statement. “Playboy with a jealous streak” is a concept.
          “Street poet” could be another. It doesn’t need to be complex,
          just a solid, archetypical idea. Think of how you’d describe your
          favorite character from a book or movie to a friend if you only
          had a couple of seconds to do it. That’s a concept.</p>
        <p>As you go through the process of character creation, if ever
          you run into hurdles or hard choices, you can always go back to
          your concept, and take the path that fits closer. For our example
          above, if you’re hard-pressed for Merit choices, you might take
          Resources, Striking Looks, Enticing, or even Street Fighting.
          Those all evoke the feeling set forth by the concept.</p>
        <p>As well, choose three Aspirations. When choosing your
          character’s Aspirations, choose one or two that reflect her
          Kindred existence. Does she want to become a leader in her
          city? Does he want to find a candidate for the Embrace? As well,
          choose at least one Aspiration pertaining to his associations
          with the mortal world. Does he have a former lover he’s
          trying to keep safe and away? Do they have a mother with
          mounting medical bills they're helping?</p>
        <p>Aspirations are one of the most important ways you can earn
          Beats and Experiences to advance your character. More
          importantly, they’re clear statements to your Storyteller about
          the types of things you wish to see happen to your character.
          It’s important the Storyteller takes note of all the troupe’s
          Aspirations. This way, she can add hooks in the chronicle to
          touch on something for everyone.</p>
        <p>Also, starting Aspirations are a great way to establish coterie
          relationships. For example, if a coterie consists of two Invictus
          characters, one may have the Aspiration, “Become a member
          of the Inner Circle,” and another might have, “Become knight
          to a ranking Invictus.” This helps to put coterie dynamics into
          a loose perspective, and can help chronicle momentum start
          strong.</p>
        <p>Lastly, Aspirations make for great fodder for quick and easy
          goals. Don’t be afraid to take at least one Aspiration without
          immense challenge or risk. For example, “Find a safe haven” isn’t
          an unreasonable goal, and it gives you something to do during
          the first session if you’re struggling to find a place for your
          character. Look at easy Aspirations as story hooks. In play, try
          to involve the other players’ characters in accomplishing them.</p>
        <p>If you’re struggling with Aspirations, revisit this stage once
          you’ve fleshed out the character some more. Often, one part
          of the character creation process will stand out for a given
          character. These stand-out parts will help you determine goals</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>2. Attributes</h2>
        <p>Now, we step into the most basic traits that define the
          character’s capability. Attributes tell us how strong, how smart,
          how charismatic they are. Look to the three categories (Mental,
          Physical, Social), and prioritize which you think is most 
          important for your character. Then, determine which is second
          most. When selecting Attributes, consider why your character may have been Embraced. 
          What drew the sire’s attention?
          Where was your character exceptional?</p>
        <p>In your primary category, place five dots and split them
          between the Attributes. In your secondary, place four. In your
          tertiary, place three.</p>
        <p>As you’ll see on your character sheet, your character gets one
          free dot in each Attribute. A single dot represents a deficient
          Attribute, something below average. Two dots represents the
          average of human ability. Three dots is above average, highly
          competent. Four dots is a remarkable specimen, a rarity. Five
          dots is the pinnacle of human capability.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>3. Skills</h2>
        <p>Next, you’ll select your character’s Skills. These have the
          same categories: Mental, Physical, and Social. Similarly, you’ll
          prioritize these three categories. Skills do not receive free dots.
          Your primary category gets eleven dots. Your secondary gets
          seven. Your tertiary gets four.</p>
        <p>When choosing Skills, think about your character’s
          background. Does your socialite have three dots of Crafts
          because she spent a lot of time in her father’s boat shop?
          Does your gangster have two dots of Socialize because he had
          to navigate the cliques of a private school as a child?</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>4. Skill Specialties</h2>
        <p>Skill dots represent training and experience with a broad
          range of techniques and procedures. Skill Specialties allow
          you to refine a few Skills, and show where your character truly
          shines. You define your own Skill Specialties. They reflect a
          narrow focus and expertise in a given Skill. For example, your
          character may have an Intimidation Specialty in Interrogation,
          or an Academics Specialty in History.</p>
        <p>Choose three Specialties. Again, use this as an opportunity to
          better understand who your character is, and who they were prior to
          the Embrace. A character with Empathy: Detecting Lies is wildly
          different than one with Empathy: Consoling. Crafts: Traps says
          something completely different from Crafts: Carpentry.</p>
        <p>In play, players will tend to solve problems with the Skills
          their characters are Specialized in. The Storyteller should expect
          this and work with it.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>5. Vampire Traits</h2>
        <p>We have the flesh and blood. Now, we add the fangs.</p>
        <h3>Clan</h3>
        <p>A character’s clan is the lineage her sire Embraced her into. 
          Clan is more archetype than personality. While the
          Disciplines and banes of the various clans may influence
          behavior, any person could be Embraced into any clan.
          There’s something to be said for playing into stereotypes, but
          challenging established norms can be very fulfilling.</p>
        <p>Your choice of clan determines the Disciplines with which
          your character has an affinity. As well, every clan has two
          favored Attributes. Take an additional dot in one of these. This
          can only take an Attribute to five dots.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><a>Daeva</a>.</b> Social predators who frequently become fascinated with their prey. 
            Favored Attributes are dexterity or manipulation. Disciplines are Celerity, <i>Majesty</i>, Vigor.</li>
          <li><b><a>Gangrel</a>.</b> Animalistic hunters with a strong connection to the Beast. They find it difficult
            to remain civil. Favored Attributes are composure of stamina. Disciplines are Animalism, <i>Protean</i>, 
            Resilience.</li>
          <li><b><a>Mekhet</a>.</b> Masters of secret and shadow, suffer the banes of vampirism most acutely.
            Favored Attributes are intelligence or wits. Disciplines are <i>Auspex</i>, Celerity, Obfuscate.</li>
          <li><b><a>Nosferatu</a>.</b> Hideously deformed or unspeakably discomforting, they are monsters that
            have difficulty interfacing with humans. Favored Attributes are composure or strength. Disciplines are 
            <i>Nightmare</i>, Obfuscate, Vigor.</li>
          <li><b><a>Ventrue</a>.</b> Regal lords of the undead. Righteous bearers of power surrounded by tools.
            Favored Attributes are presence or resolve. Disciplines are Animalism, <i>Dominate</i>, Resilience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disciplines</h3>
        <p>Disciplines are extensions of the Blood. They are ways the
          Beast’s tendrils creep out into the world to manipulate, to
          pervert, and to destroy. These unholy tricks can accomplish
          nefarious and terrifying things, from changing the vampire into
          an animal to forcing a victim into an artificial love.</p>
        <p>Choose three dots in Disciplines. At least two must be
          from the vampire’s in-clan Disciplines. The third dot may
          be from any Discipline. If you choose a third Discipline dot
          from a non-clan Discipline, consider how your character 
          learned it. Did she have a mentor? Did she steal the blood
          of another clan?</p>
