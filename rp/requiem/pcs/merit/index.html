               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Resolve •• and one Skill Specialty</p>
               <p>Your character is uncommonly specialized in one area. Choose a Skill Specialty. If you would gain a bonus from that Skill Specialty, you may
                  take +2 instead of +1.</p-->
               <h3 id='DangerSense'>Danger Sense (••)</h3>
               <p>Your character's reflexes are finely honed. You gain a +2 modifier on reflexive Wits +
               Composure rolls for your character to detect an impending ambush.</p>
               <h3 id='EideticMemory'>Eidetic Memory (••)</h3>
               <p>Your character recalls events and details with
               pinpoint accuracy. You do not have to make rolls for your
               character to remember past experiences. When making
               Intelligence + Composure (or relevant Skill) rolls to recall
               minute facts from swaths of information, take a +2 bonus.</p>
               <h3 id='EncyclopedicKnowledge'>Encyclopedic Knowledge (••)</h3>
               <p>Choose a Skill. Due to an immersion in academia, pop culture, or a hobby obsession, your character has collected 
               limitless factoids about the topic, even if she has no dots in the Skill.</p>
               <p>You can make an Intelligence + Wits roll at any time your
               character is dealing with her area of interest. On a successful
               roll, the Storyteller must give a relevant fact or detail about
               the issue at hand. Your character knows this fact, but you
               must explain within the scope of your character’s background
               why she knows it. For example, for Encyclopedic Knowledge:
               Medicine: “Do you remember that time on that show, when
               the doctor said it doesn’t manifest before puberty?”</p>
               <h3 id='FastReflexes'>Fast Reflexes (• to •••)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Wits ••• or Dexterity •••</p>
               <p>Your character is always fast to react. Take +1 Initiative per dot</p>
               <!--h3 id='Holistic Awareness'>Holistic Awareness •</h3>
               <p>Your character is skilled at non-traditional healing
               methods. While scientific minds might scoff, he can provide
               basic medical care with natural means. He knows what herbs can Mental Merits 45
               stem an infection, and what minerals will stave off a minor sickness. Unless your patient suffers wound penalties from lethal or
               aggravated wounds, you do not need traditional medical equipment to stabilize and treat injuries. With access to woodlands, a
               greenhouse, or other source of diverse flora, a Wits + Survival
               roll allows your character to gather all necessary supplies.</p-->
               <h3 id='Indomitable'>Indomitable (••)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Resolve •••</p>
               <p>Your character possesses an iron will. The powers of the
               supernatural have little bearing on their behavior. They can
               stand up to a vampire’s mind control, a witch’s charms, or a
               ghost’s gifts of fright. Any time a supernatural creature uses
               a power to influence your character’s thoughts or emotions,
               add two dice to the dice pool to contest it. If the roll is resisted,
               instead subtract two dice from the monster’s dice pool. Note
               that this only affects mental influence and manipulation
               from a supernatural origin. A vampire with a remarkable
               Manipulation + Persuasion score is just as likely to convince
               your character to do something using mundane tricks.</p>
               <h3 id='Language'>Language (•)</h3>
               <p>Your character is skilled with an additional language, beyond their native tongue. Choose a language each
               time you buy this Merit. Your character can speak, read, and write in that language.</p>
               <!--h3 id='Library'>Library • to •••</h3>
               <p>Your character has access to a well of information about a given topic. When purchasing this Merit,
               choose a Mental Skill. The Library covers that purview. On
               any extended roll involving the Skill in question, add the
               dots in this Merit.</p>
               <p>This Merit can be purchased multiple times, to reflect
               different Skills. Additionally, its benefits can be shared by
               various characters, with permission.</p>
               <h3 id='ToleranceforBiology'>Tolerance for Biology •</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Resolve •••</p>
               <p>Most people turn away at the sight of blood,
               other bodily fluids, or exotic biology. Your character has
               seen enough that nothing turns her stomach. When other
               characters must resist shock or physical repulsion from the
               disgusting and morbid, your character stands her ground. You
               do not need to make Composure, Stamina, or Resolve rolls
               to withstand the biologically strange. This doesn’t mean she’s
               immune to fear; she’s just used to nature in all its nasty forms.</p-->
               <h3 id='TrainedObserver'>Trained Observer (• or •••)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Wits ••• or Composure •••</p>
               <p>Your character has spent years in the field, catching tiny details and digging for secrets. They might not have a
               better chance of finding things, but they have a better chance of finding important things. Any time you make a Perception
               roll (usually Wits + Composure), you benefit from the 9-again quality. With the three-dot version, you get 8-again.</p>

               <h2 id="PhysicalMerits">Physical Merits</h2>
               <h3 id='FleetofFoot'>Fleet of Foot (• to •••)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Athletics ••</p>
               <p>Your character is remarkably quick, and runs far
               faster than their frame suggests. He gains +1 Speed per dot,
               and anyone pursuing him suffers a -1 per dot to any foot
               chase rolls.</p>
               <h3 id='Hardy'>Hardy (• to •••)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Stamina •••</p>
               <p>Your character’s body goes further than it rightfully should. Add the dots in this Merit to any rolls to resist
               disease, poison, deprivation, unconsciousness, or suffocation.</p>
               <h3 id='IronStamina'>Iron Stamina (• to •••)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Stamina ••• or Resolve •••</p>
               <p>Each dot eliminates a negative modifier (on a one-for-one basis) when resisting the effects of fatigue or injury.
               For example: A character with Iron Stamina •• is able to
               ignore up to a -2 modifier brought on by fatigue. The Merit
               also counteracts the effects of wound penalties. So, if all
               of your character’s Health boxes are filled (which normally
               imposes a -3 penalty to his actions) and he has Iron Stamina
               •, those penalties are reduced to -2. This Merit cannot be
               used to gain positive modifiers for actions, only to cancel
               out negative ones.</p>
               <h3 id='QuickDraw'>Quick Draw (•)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Wits •••, a Specialty in the weapon or fighting style chosen</p>
               <p>Choose a Specialty in Weaponry or Firearms when you purchase this Merit. Your character has trained in that
               weapon or style enough that pulling the weapon is his first
               reflex. Drawing or holstering that weapon is considered a reflexive action, and can be done any time his Defense applies.</p>
            </div>

               <h2 id="SocialMerits">Social Merits</h2>
               <h3 id="Allies">Allies (• to •••••)</h3>
               <p>Allies help your character. They might be friends,
               employees, associates, or people your character has blackmailed. Each instance of this Merit represents one type of
               ally. This could be an organization, a society, a clique, or
               an individual. Examples include the police, a secret society,
               criminal organizations, unions, local politicians, or the academic community. Each purchase has its own rating. Your
               character might have Allies (Masons) ••, Allies (Carter Crime
               Family) •••, and Allies (Catholic Church) •.</p>
               <p>Each dot represents a layer of influence in the group.
               One dot would constitute small favors and passing influence. Three could offer considerable influence, such as the
               police overlooking a misdemeanor charge. Five dots stretches
               the limits of the organization’s influence, as its leaders put
               their own influence on the line for the character. This could
               include things such as massive insider trading or fouling up
               a felony investigation. No matter the request, it has to be
               something that organization could accomplish.</p>
               <p>The Storyteller assigns a rating between one and five to
               any favor asked. A character can ask for favors that add up to
               her Allies rating without penalty in one chapter. If she extends
               her influence beyond that, her player must roll Manipulation
               + Persuasion + Allies, with a penalty equal to the favor’s
               rating. If the roll is successful, the group does as requested.
               Failed or successful, the character loses a dot of Allies. This
               dot may return at the end of the chapter. On a dramatic failure, the organization
               resents her and seeks retribution. On an exceptional success,
               she doesn’t lose the dot.</p>
               <p>One additional favor a character can ask of her Allies is to
               block another character’s Allies, Contacts, Mentor, Retainer,
               or Status (if she knows the character possesses the relevant
               Merit). The rating is equal to the Merit dots blocked. As
               before, no roll is necessary unless the target’s Merit exceeds
               the character’s Allies. If the block succeeds, the character
               cannot use the Merit during the same chapter.</p>
               <h3 id='Contacts'>Contacts (• to •••••)</h3>
               <p>Contacts provide your character with information.
               Each dot in this Merit represents a sphere or organization with
               which the character can garner information. For example, a
               character with Contacts ••• might have Bloggers, Drug Dealers,
               and Financial Speculators for connections. Contacts do not
               provide services, only information. This may be face-to-face, via
               email, by telephone, or even by séance in some strange instances.</p>
               <p>Garnering information via Contacts requires a
               Manipulation + Social Skill roll, depending on the method
               the character uses, and the relationship between the characters.
               The Storyteller should give a bonus or penalty, dependent on
               how relevant the information is to that particular Contact,
               whether accessing the information is dangerous, and if the
               character has maintained good relations or done favors for
               the Contact. These modifiers should range from -3 to +3 in
               most cases. If successful, the Contact provides the information.</p>
               <p>One use of a Contact is to dig dirt on another character.
               A Contact can find another character’s Social Merits, and any
               relevant Conditions (<a href='../../rules/conditions/index.html#Guilty'>Guilty</a> is a prime example.)</p>
               <p>A character can have more than five Contacts, but the
               Merit’s rating is limited to five, for the purposes of Allies
               blocking.</p>
               <h3 id='Fame'>Fame (• to •••)</h3>
               <p>Your character is recognized within a certain
               sphere, for a certain skill, or because of some past action or
               stroke of luck. This can mean favors and attention, it can also
               mean negative attention and scrutiny. When choosing the
               Merit, define what your character is known for. As a rule of
               thumb, one dot means local recognition, or reputation within
               a confined subculture. Two dots means regional recognition
               by a wide swath of people. Three dots means worldwide
               recognition to anyone that might have been exposed to the
               source of the fame. Each dot adds a die to any Social rolls
               among those who are impressed by your character’s celebrity.</p>
               <p><b>Drawback:</b> Any rolls to find or identify the character
               enjoy a +1 bonus per dot of the Merit. If the character has
               Alternate Identity, she can mitigate this drawback. A character
               with Fame cannot have the Anonymity Merit.</p>

               <p>This Merit reflects your character’s disposable income. She might live in an upscale condo, but if her income
               is tied up in the mortgage and child support payments, she
               might have little money to throw around. Characters are assumed to have basic necessities without Resources.</p>
               <p>The dot rating determines the relative amount of disposable funding the character has available, depending on your
               particular chronicle’s setting. The same amount of money
               means completely different things in a game set in Silicon
               Valley compared to one set in the Detroit slums. One dot is
               a little spending money here and there. Two is a comfortable,
               middle class wage. Three is a nicer, upper middle class life.
               Four is moderately wealthy. Five is filthy rich.</p>
               <p>Every item has an Availability rating. Once per chapter, your
               character can procure an item at her Resources level or lower,
               without issue. An item one Availability above her Resources
               reduces her effective Resources by one dot for a full month, since
               she has to rapidly liquidate funds. She can procure items two
               Availability below her Resources without limit (within reason).
               For example, a character with Resources •••• can procure as
               many Availability •• disposable cellphones as she needs.</p>
               <h3 id='Retainer'>Retainer (• to •••••)</h3>
               <p>Your character has an assistant, sycophant, ser-
               vant, or follower on whom she can rely. Establish who this
               companion is, and how he was acquired. It may be as simple
               as a paycheck. He might owe your character his life. However
               it happened, your character has a hold on him.</p>
               <p>A Retainer is more reliable than a Mentor, and more
               loyal than an Ally. On the other hand, a Retainer is a lone
               person, less capable and influential than the broader Merits.
               The Merit’s dot rating determines the relative competency
               of the Retainer. A one-dot Retainer is barely able to do
               anything of use, such as a pet that knows one useful trick,
               or a homeless old man that does minor errands for food. A
               three-dot Retainer is a professional in their field, someone
               capable in his line of work. A five-dot is one of the best in
               her class. If a Retainer needs to make a roll, and it’s within
               her field, double the dot rating and use it as a dice pool. For
               anything else, use the dot rating as a dice pool.</p>
               <p>This Merit can be purchased multiple times to represent
               multiple Retainers.</p>
               <h3 id='Status'>Status (• to •••••)</h3>
               <p>Your character has standing, membership, author-
               ity, control over, or respect from a group or organization. This
               can reflect official standing, or merely informal respect. No
               matter the source, your character enjoys certain privileges
               within that structure.</p>
               <p>Each instance of this Merit reflects standing in a differ-
               ent group or organization. Your character may have Status
               (The Luck Gang) •••, Status (Drag Racing Circuit) ••, and
               Status (Police) •. Each affords its own unique benefits. As
               you increase dot ratings, your character rises in prominence
               in the relevant group.</p>
               <p>Status only allows advantages within the confines of
               the group reflected in the Merit. Status (Organized Crime)
               won’t help if your character wants an official concealed carry
               firearms permit, for example.</p>
               <p>Status provides a number of advantages:</p>
               <p>First, your character can apply her Status to any Social roll
               with those over which she has authority or sway.</p>
               <p>Second, she has access to group facilities, resources, and
               funding. Depending on the group, this could be limited by
               red tape and requisitioning processes. It’s also dependent on
               the resources the particular group has available.</p>
               <p>Third, she has pull. If she knows a character’s Mentor,
               Resources, Retainer, Contacts, or Allies, she can block their
               usage. Once per chapter, she can stop a single Merit from
               being used, if it’s of a lower dot rating than her Status, and
               if it makes sense for her organization to obstruct that type
               of person’s behavior. In our Organized Crime example, if
               your character knows that the chief of police has Contacts
               (Criminal Informant), you may opt to block usage by threat-
               ening the informant into silence.</p>
               <p><b>Drawback:</b> Status requires upkeep, and often regular du-
               ties. If these duties are not upheld, the Status may be lost. The
               dots will not be accessible until the character re-establishes her
               standing. In our Organized Crime example, your character
               may be expected to pay protection money, offer tribute to a
               higher authority, or undertake felonious activities.</p>
               <h3 id='StrikingLooks'>Striking Looks (• or ••)</h3>
               <p>Your character is stunning, alarming, commanding, repulsive, threatening, charming, or otherwise worthy
               of attention. Determine how your character looks and how
               people react to that. For one dot, your character gets a +1 bonus on any Social rolls that would be influenced by his looks.
               For two dots, the benefit increases to +2. Depending on the
               particulars, this might influence Expression, Intimidation,
               Persuasion, Subterfuge, or other rolls.</p>
               <p><b>Drawback:</b> Attention is a double-edged sword. Any rolls
               to spot, notice, or remember your character gain the same
               dice bonus. Sometimes, your character will draw unwanted
               attention in social situations. This could cause further
               complications.</p>

               <h3 id="Cursed">Cursed (••)</h3>
               <p>Your character has run afoul of fate. Somewhere,
               somehow, he’s been cursed. Most importantly, he’s aware of
               the curse. When taking this Merit, define the limitations of
               the curse. Usually, it’s expressed in the form of a single statement, such as, “On the eve of your twenty-seventh birthday,
               you will feast upon your doom.” It’s important to work out
               the details with the Storyteller. The curse must take effect
               within the scope of the planned chronicle.</p>
               <p>While he knows how he’ll die, this is a liberating experience. He’s confident of the method of his death, so nothing
               else fazes him. Gain a +2 on any Resolve + Composure roll
               to face fear or self-doubt. Any time he takes lethal damage in
               his last three health boxes, take an additional Beat.</p>
               <h3 id='UnseenSense'>Unseen Sense (••)</h3>
               <p>Your character has a “sixth sense” for a type of
               supernatural creature, chosen when you buy the Merit. For
               example, you may choose Unseen Sense: Vampires, or Unseen
               Sense: Fairies. The sense manifests differently for everyone.
               Her hair stands on end, she becomes physically ill, or perhaps she has a cold chill. Regardless, she knows that something
               isn’t right when she is in the immediate proximity of the appropriate supernatural being. Once per chapter, the player
               can accept the <a href='../../rules/conditions/index.html#Spooked'>Spooked Condition</a>, in exchange for
               which the character can pinpoint where the feeling is coming
               from. If the target is using a power that specifically cloaks its
               supernatural nature, however, this does not work (though
               the Condition remains until resolved as usual).</p>

               <h3 id='CloseQuartersCombat'>Close Quarters Combat (• to •••••; Style)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Wits •••, Athletics ••, Brawl •••</p>
               <p>Your character knows that hitting someone in the face
               is an easy way to break the little bones in his hand. To that
               end, he’s perfected the art of using the environment to hurt
               people.</p>
               <p><b>Firing Lines •:</b> In some situations, your character’s best
               option is a tactical retreat — especially if he’s inadvertently
               brought a knife to a gunfight. He can run for cover as a reaction to a ranged attack instead of dropping prone. You give
               up your action for the turn, but your character can get to any
               cover that’s within twice his Speed.</p>
               <p><b>Hard Surfaces ••:</b> Bouncing someone’s head off a
               urinal, computer monitor, or brick wall is a handy way to
               increase the amount of hurt inflicted while not breaking the
               aforementioned hand bones. When your character is grap-
               pling someone, he can bounce them off a hard surface with
               a Damage move. He deals lethal damage, then immediately
               ends the grapple.</p>
               <p><b>Armored Coffin •••:</b> The problem with protection is
               simple: the very things that protect your opponents can be
               turned against them. That holds true for body armor just as
               much as anything else. Sure, it blocks bullets and knives, but
               get in a clinch and your character’s opponent might as well
               be wearing a straightjacket. When he grapples an opponent,
               add their general armor rating to your dice pool. When he
               uses a Damage move, ignore his opponent’s armor. This
               technique can’t be used in conjunction with Hard Surfaces.</p>
               <p><b>Prep Work ••••:</b> If your character has a second to look
               around, he can catch someone by surprise almost anywhere.
               When launching a surprise attack, your Dexterity + Stealth
               roll becomes a rote action.</p>
               <p><b>Drawback:</b> Your character can’t use this Merit to set up
               sniper attacks — his ambush must use Brawl or Weaponry.</p>
               <p><b>Turnabout •••••:</b> If your character’s caught short in a
               fight, his opponent’s weapon suits him just fine. When he
               attempts to Disarm his opponent, step the results up one level
               — on a failure, his opponent drops the weapon. On a success,
               your character takes possession of his opponent’s weapon. On
               an exceptional success, your character has the weapon and
               his opponent takes two points of bashing damage.</p>
               <h3 id='DefensiveCombat'>Defensive Combat •</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Brawl • or Weaponry •; choose one when this Merit is selected</p>
               <p>Your character is trained in avoiding damage in
               combat. Use her Brawl or Weaponry to calculate Defense,
               rather than Athletics. Your character can learn both versions
               of this Merit, allowing you to use any of the three Skills to
               calculate Defense. However, you cannot use Weaponry to calculate Defense unless she actually has a weapon in her hand.</p>
               <h3 id='FightingFinesse'>Fighting Finesse ••</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dexterity •••, a Specialty in Weaponry or Brawl</p>
               <p>Choose a Specialty in Weaponry or Brawl when
               you purchase this Merit. Your character’s extensive training
               in that particular weapon or style has allowed them to benefit
               more from their alacrity and agility than their strength. You
               may substitute your character’s Dexterity for her Strength
               when making rolls with that Specialty.</p>
               <p>This Merit may be purchased multiple times to gain its
               benefit with multiple Specialties.</p>
               <h3 id='Firefight'>Firefight (• to •••; Style)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Composure •••, Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Firearms ••</p>
               <p>Your character is comfortable with a gun. She’s
               been trained in stressful situations, and knows how to keep
               herself from being shot, while still shooting at her opponents.
               This Style is about moving, strafing, and taking shots when
               you get them. It’s not a series of precision techniques; it’s for
               using a gun practically in a real-world situation.</p>
               <p><b>Shoot First •:</b> In a firefight, the person shot first is usually
               the loser. Your character has trained herself to fire first in an
               altercation. If her gun is drawn, add her Firearms score to her
               Initiative. If she has Quick Draw, she can use Shoot First to draw
               and fire with increased Initiative in the first turn of combat.</p>
               <p><b>Suppressive Fire ••:</b> Sometimes, the purpose of a shot
               is to distract, not necessarily to hit. Your character is trained
               to fire off a handful of rounds with the intent to startle opponents and force impulse reactions. When using the Covering
               Fire maneuver (p. 90), her opponents cannot benefit from aiming against her. She can apply her Defense against incoming Firearms attacks, 
               in addition to any cover bonuses.
               Additionally, her training allows her to use Suppressive Fire
               with a semi-automatic weapon.</p>
               <p><b>Secondary Target •••:</b> Sometimes, shooting an opponent behind cover is all but impossible. However, a bullet
               can knock objects off balance, or cause ricochets. By using
               Secondary Target, your character opts not to hit her target,
               but instead strike them with any collateral objects that might
               be nearby. She causes bashing damage instead of lethal, but
               ignores all cover penalties to the roll. The weapon’s damage
               rating does not add to the damage in this case.</p>
               <h3 id='ImprovisedWeaponry'>Improvised Weaponry (• to •••; Style)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Wits •••, Weaponry •</p>
               <p>Most people don’t walk around armed. While someone
               pulling a knife or a gun can cool a hostile situation down, it
               can also cause things to boil over — an argument that wouldn’t
               be more than harsh words suddenly ends up with three
               people in the morgue. If your character is on the receiving
               end of someone pulling a knife, it helps to have something
               in his hand as well.</p>
               <p>Your character is good at making do with what he’s got.
               Sometimes he’s lucky — if your character’s in a bar, he’s
               got a lot of glass bottles, or maybe a pool cue, to play with.
               However, he’s got something like a sixth sense, and can find
               a weapon almost anywhere.</p>
               <p><b>Always Armed •:</b> Your character can always get his
               hands on something dangerous, and he has an instinctive
               understanding of how to put it to good — and deadly — use. At
               the start of your turn, make a reflexive Wits + Weaponry roll
               to grab an object suitable for use as a weapon in pretty much
               any environment. (The player is encouraged to work with the
               Storyteller to determine an appropriate item — a large, jagged
               rock in the wilderness, for example, or a heavy glass ashtray
               with one sharp, broken edge in a dive bar.) Regardless of
               what he picks up, the weapon has a +0 weapon modifier, -1
               initiative penalty, Size 1, Durability 2, and Structure 4. On
               an exceptional success, increase the weapon modifier and
               Size by 1, but the initiative penalty increases to -2. Whatever
               your character grabs doesn’t cause you to suffer the normal
               -1 penalty for wielding an improvised weapon (see p. 94).</p>
               <p><b>In Harm’s Way ••:</b> Your character’s got a knack for putting his weapon in the way of an oncoming attack, no matter
               how small or inappropriate for blocking it might be. While
               he’s wielding an improvised weapon acquired with Always
               Armed, you can treat the Structure of your character’s weapon
               as general armor against a single Brawl or Weaponry attack.
               Any damage he takes inflicts an equal amount of damage to
               the improvised weapon, bypassing Durability. Your character
               can use the weapon to attack later in the same turn, but can
               only use this ability when applying his Defense to an attack.</p>
               <p><b>Breaking Point •••:</b> One sure way to win a fight is to
               hit the other guy so hard that he doesn’t get back up, even
               if that means losing a weapon in the process. When making
               an all-out attack with an improvised weapon acquired with
               Always Armed, you can reduce the weapon’s Structure by
               any amount down to a minimum of 0. Every 2 points of
               Structure spent in this way adds 1 to the weapon modifier
               for that one single attack. Declare any Structure loss before
               making the attack; this Structure is reduced even if the attack
               does no damage. If the weapon is reduced to 0 Structure, it
               is automatically destroyed after the attack. You can use this
               technique in conjunction with In Harm’s Way, allowing your
               character to parry an attack made on a higher Initiative and
               then go on the offensive, provided that the weapon wasn’t
               destroyed.</p>
               <h3 id='MartialArts'>Martial Arts (• to •••••; Style)</h3>
               <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Resolve •••, Dexterity •••, Athletics ••, Brawl ••</p>
               <p>Your character is trained in one or more formal martial arts styles. This may have come from a personal mentor, a
               dojo, or a self-defense class. It may have been for exercise, protection, show, or tradition. These
               maneuvers may only be used unarmed, or with weapons
               capable of using the Brawl Skill, such as a punch dagger,
               or a weapon using the Shiv Merit (see below).</p>
               <p><b>Focused Attack •:</b> Your character has trained extensively in striking specific parts of an opponent’s body.
               Reduce penalties for hitting specific targets by one.
               Additionally, you may ignore one point of armor on any
               opponent.</p>
               <p><b>Defensive Strike ••:</b> Your character excels in defending herself while finding the best time to strike. You can
               add 1 or 2 points to your character’s Defense. For each
               Defense point you take, subtract a die from any attacks you
               make. This can only be used in a turn in which your character intends to attack. It cannot be used with a Dodge.</p>
               <p><b>Whirlwind Strike •••:</b> When engaged, your character becomes a storm of threatening kicks and punches;
               nothing close is safe. As long as your character has
               her Defense available to her, and is not
               Dodging, any character coming into arm’s
               reach takes one bashing damage. This damage continues once per turn as long as the
               enemy stays within range, and occurs on
               the enemy’s turn. If you spend a point
               of Willpower, this damage becomes two
               bashing until your next turn.</p>
               <p><b>The Hand As Weapon ••••:</b> With this degree of training, your character’s
               limbs are hardened to cause massive trauma. Her unarmed strikes cause
               lethal damage.</p>
               <p><b>The Touch of Death •••••:</b> Your character’s mastery has brought with
               it the daunting power of causing lethal injury with a touch. If she chooses, her
               unarmed strikes count as weapons with two damage rating.</p>
