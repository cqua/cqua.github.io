  			<p>
          This game uses ten-sided dice. When there is uncertainty, build a dice pool, roll, and count your successes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the time, your dice pool will be equal to an <a href="#Attributes">attribute</a> plus a 
          <a href="#Skills">skill</a>. Many rolls also have modifiers due to equipemnt, circumstance, or opposition.
  			</p>
        <p>
          Each die that shows an 8, 9, or 10 is a success. Normally, you only need one success to achieve your goal, 
          but more successes is always better. For each die that shows 10, you may count the success and roll it again, 
          potentially scoring another success. If this second roll comes up as another 10, count the success and
          roll it again, on until you roll a number other than 10.
  			</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Success</b>: With <b>1 or more successes</b> (a die showing 8, 9, or 10), you succeed. Things go as planned.</li>
          <li><b>Failure</b>: With <b>no successes</b>, you fail. You don't get what you want and complications are headed your way.</li>
          <li><b>Exceptional Success</b>: With <b>5 or more successes</b>, your character’s action succeeds
            beyond expectation. Your character gains a beneficial <a href="#Conditions">condition</a>, usually, the 
            <a href="#Inspired">Inspired Condition</a>. You can give this Condition to another character when it’s 
            appropriate to the story.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your pool drops below one die, you instead roll a single <b>chance die</b>. The chance die only counts 
          as a success if you roll a 10, which you do not reroll. Any other result is a failure.
          If you roll a 1 on the chance die, your character suffers a <b>Dramatic Failure</b>- your character fails 
          badly, and things are about to get a whole lot worse.
  			</p>
      </div>
      <div>
  			<h2 id="Attributes">Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Attributes are the basic abilities that every character possesses, and are the foundation for most rolls. 
          There are nine Attributes, split between the Mental, Physical, and Social categories.
        </p>
        <p>All characters start with one dot in each Attribute, which
          is below average for that Attribute. Two dots represents
          average ability, three dots is above average, and four dots is
          someone who is truly exceptional. A character with five dots
          in an Attribute has reached the peak of human potential
          within that ability.
        </p>
  			<h3 id="MentalAttributes">Mental Attributes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Intelligence</b> is your character’s book smarts and ability to process data. It represents memory, general 
            knowledge, and ability to solve complex and difficult problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Wits</b> represents quick thinking and improvisation. A character with a high Wits responds quickly to 
            new information and situations. It also represents perception and the ability
            to notice details and subtle tells.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Resolve</b> represents your character’s patience, concentra-
            tion, and determination. A high Resolve allows a character
            to focus despite distractions or discouragement.
          </li>
        </ul>
  			<h3 id="PhysicalAttributes">Physical Attributes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Strength</b> is a character’s muscular power and ability to use
            the force of her body. It is used for a large number of physical
            tasks, and is important for most applications of violence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dexterity</b> represents hand-eye coordination, agility, and
            physical speed. A character with a high Dexterity has fast
            reactions, a good sense of balance, and accurate control of
            physical force.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stamina</b> is your character’s general fitness and health. It
            is used for sustained effort, as well as determining how much
            physical punishment your body can take.
          </li>
        </ul>
  			<h3 id="SocialAttributes">Social Attributes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Presence</b> is a character’s raw charisma, assertiveness, and
            ability to command. Characters with a high Presence domi-
            nate a room and are adept at changing people’s thoughts
            and moods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Manipulation</b> epresents your character’s ability to choose
            his words, mask his intentions, and convince others to go
            along with his ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Composure</b> is a character’s ability to keep control of her
            emotions and resist others’ manipulations. It also represents
            poise, dignity, and the ability to keep a level head when under
            fire (metaphorically or literally).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
  			<h2 id="Skills">Skills</h2>
        <p>
          Skills are learned and practiced abilities, rather than the innate
          abilities that Attributes represent. Skills reflect a character’s origins
          and interests, and can be acquired in many ways, from institution-
          alized learning to hands-on experience. Skills are divided into the
          same Mental, Physical, and Social categories as Attributes.
        </p>

          <li>

            others’ feelings and motivations. It can represent careful
            observation of body language, tone, and other cues, or it

            <b>Persuasion</b> is about using influence, charm, and careful
            arguments to change minds and influence behavior. It can

          <li>
            <b>Socialize</b> is the art of small talk, polite gestures,
            and fitting in. It represents your ability to interact with people
            in a variety of social settings, from dive bars to state dinners.

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="Health">Health</h2>
        <p>Characters can suffer three types of damage. Fists and feet,
          along with other kinds of low-impact trauma, deal bashing
          damage. Brass knuckles, knives, and speeding carriages deal
          lethal damage. Kindred take bashing damage from all mundane
          weapons, because they’re less fazed by pain and don’t depend
          on their internal organs.</p>
        <p>Some horrifying powers — along with the great banes of the
          Kindred — deal aggravated damage. When something deals
          aggravated damage directly, it’s quite obvious. Flesh bubbles
          and sloughs away. Foaming pustules taint the victim’s flesh.
          Blackened veins streak out from the site of the injury.</p>
        <p>If a vampire’s health track is filled with bashing damage,
          she remains conscious. If it fills with lethal damage, she falls
          into torpor. If it fills with aggravated damage, she suffers Final
          Death, and her body rots as though she had died on the date
          of her Embrace.</p>
        <p>A character’s Health track contains a number of boxes
          equal to his Health trait, determined by his Stamina + Size.</p>
        <h3 id="MarkingDamage">Marking Damage</h3>
        <p>When a character suffers bashing damage, mark it with a
          slash (/) in the leftmost empty box of his health track.</p><p>
          When a character suffers lethal damage, mark it with an
          X in the leftmost box of his health track that doesn’t contain
          lethal or aggravated damage. If you mark over a point of
          bashing damage, it moves one box to the right.</p><p>
          When a character suffers aggravated damage, mark it with
          a large asterisk (*) in the leftmost box that doesn’t already
          contain aggravated damage. If you mark over a point of
          bashing or lethal damage, it all moves one box to the right.</p><p>
          Always mark the most severe injuries at the left of a
          character’s health track, and push any less severe injuries to
          the right. Characters heal their rightmost health boxes first
          and progress left</p>
        <h3 id="WoundPenalties">Wound Penalties</h3>
        <p>As a character takes damage, it impairs her ability to act.
          When one of her three rightmost Health boxes has damage marked, she suffers a penalty accordingly. 
          Subtract this penalty from every action she performs, including rolling for
          Initiative, but not including Stamina rolls to stay conscious.</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Health Boxes Marked</th><th>Penalty</th></tr>
          <tr><td class="center">Third-to-last</td><td class="center">-1</td></tr>
          <tr><td class="center">Second-to-last</td><td class="center">-2</tr>
          <tr><td class="center">Last</td><td class="center">-3</tr>
        </table>
        <h3 id="FullHealthTracks">Full Health Tracks</h3>
        <p>If a character’s Health track is filled with bashing damage,
          each point of further bashing or lethal damage upgrades the
          leftmost point of bashing damage to lethal — turn one of the
          slashes into an X. When a character’s rightmost Health box
          has bashing damage marked in it, his player must make a
          reflexive Stamina roll each turn for him to remain conscious.</p>
        <p>If a character’s Health track is filled with lethal damage,
          each point of further damage upgrades an existing point of
          lethal damage to aggravated. Turn the leftmost X into an
          asterisk. When a character’s rightmost Health box has lethal
          damage marked in it, he takes another point of damage each
          minute (upgrading existing lethal damage to aggravated) until
          he receives medical attention, mundane or supernatural.</p>
        <p>If a character’s Health track is filled with aggravated
          damage, he’s dead.</p>
        <h3>Healing</h3>
        <p>Unlike mortals who rely on time and medical care to recover from injury, kindred use their 
          vitae to return their bodies to the state of their embrace. Kindred have no use for medical care.</p>
        <p>For information on kindred healing, see <a href="../rules/vampirism#Regeneration">Regeneration</a>.</p>

        <p>A character’s Willpower represents their determination and
          ability to go above and beyond what should be possible to achieve their goals. 
          Spending a point of Willpower adds a +3 die
          bonus to most dice pools, or +2 to a Resistance trait. You can
          only spend one point of Willpower per action.</p>
        <p>Willpower is regained by taking actions according to your <a>Mask</a>, <a>Dirge</a>, and <a>Touchstone</a>.</p>
        <p>A vampire’s Willpower score is equal to their Resolve + Composure.</p>
