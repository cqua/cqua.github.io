            </div>
            <div>
               <p>The Kindred, or vampires as outsiders call them, have certain differences from the vampires you have encountered throughout literature and 
                  popular culture. Kindred are numerous and diverse, but have the following common traits:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li class="py-1"><b>Vampirism is a curse of undeath.</b> The vampire is a corpse coursing with arcane blood called vitae. They do not age, breathe, undergo natural healing,
                        or perform human activities such as eating or coitus.</li>
                     <li class="py-1"><b>Vampires must consume blood and only blood.</b> A young vampire can feed on animal blood, but thirst grows with age, and soon only live
                        humans can satiate. Elders feed only on other vampires. Anything eaten is rejected by the body in a painful and messy manner.<br/>
                        A well fed vampire will live forever in a vacuum.</li>
                     <li class="py-1"><b>The curse is transmitted through a willful process called the Embrace.</b> The mortal must be drained of all blood, killing them. The sire then quickly 
                        feeds the corpse a few drops of vitae. The mortal will become a kindred and rise in undeath as childe to the sire.</li>
                     <li class="py-1"><b>The sun is extremely dangerous to vampires.</b> During daylight hours, vampires are drained of energy and must enter a death-like slumber called daysleep,
                        or else maintain intense focus to remain awake. Additionally, exposure to direct sunlight for even a short period will cause a vampire to ignite and burn to 
                        ash.</li>
                     <li class="py-1"><b>Vampires have a diverse range of abilities fueled by vitae.</b> This includes inhuman strength, toughness, and agility. They can expend vitae to heal,
                        returning them to the state of their Embrace. They can even imitate the "Blush of Life", allowing them to appear convincingly human and perform mortal 
                        activities.<br/>Vitae is replenished through mortal blood.</li>
                     <li class="py-1"><b>Vampires are compelled to sustain themselves by a psychic force called the Beast.</b> The Beast is the voice of the curse made manifest, 
                        ensuring all kindred drink blood, flee the sun, and persist relentlessly. Opposing the Beast means facing a screaming wall of psychic energy 
                        and risking the Beast wresting control in a frenzy. The beast makes you a monster.</li>
                     <li class="py-1"><b>To slay a vampire, stake it in the heart, sever the head, and burn the remains.</b>There are many myths about vampires' weaknesses: 
                        garlic, running water, salt, silver. Outside of rare cases, these are merely fiction.<br/>
                        Fire, however, spreads quickly across the kindreds body and the Beast fears it instinctually. A stake through the heart won't kill a vampire, 
                        but it will sap the vitae, paralyzing them. Severing the head disconnects the brain from the heart, which is the only certain way of preventing 
                        regeneration.</li>
                  </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 id="Feeding">Feeding</h2>
              <p><b>Human blood</b> is best warm, from the living. Kindred can pull a number of Vitae from a mortal equal to the mortal’s
                  unmodified Health dots. Every point of Vitae they take causes one point of lethal damage. If they take more Vitae than the
                  human has dots of Stamina, the human suffers the <a href='../conditions.html#Drained'>Drained Condition</a>. Once a vampire attains their sixth dot of Blood
                  Potency, they no longer find human blood nourishing.</p>
               <blockquote class=" bg-grey blockquote card-body">The average human has 8 dots of health. Assuming the human is in good health, 
                  the kindred can take 7 vitae and still leave them conscious (though likely unstable). A human recovers 1 point of lethal damage every 2 days. 
                  Given kindred require at minimum 1 vitae a day, <b>one kindred cannot be sustained by only one source of blood</b>.</blockquote><p></p>
               <p><b>Cold blood</b> from a corpse or kept outside the body for more than a few minutes (but no more than a night) is far
                  less satisfying. To gain a single point of Vitae, a vampire must consume as many pints of this blood as their Blood Potency times 
                  two. Technologically stored blood, for example in refrigerated plasma bags, is similarly unpalatable to potent Kindred.</p>
               <p><b>Kindred vitae</b> is efficient- every Vitae taken is a Vitae earned, causing no damage. It is dangerous however, as the drinker risks <a>addiction</a> or
                  the formation of a <a>blood bond</a>. Additionally, the act of <a>diablerie</a>, to drink another kindred to death and further drink their very animating essence
                  is tantamount to cannibalism and one of the greatest taboos in kindred society.</p>
               <p><b>Animal blood</b> is a challenging meal that provides only limited sustenance for kindred with blood potency 2 or less. 
                  The amount of vitae provided depends on size of the animal. Cats, chickens, and large rats provide a single point of Vitae and are invariably killed in the process. 
                  A mid-size dog will provide 2. Adult goats and sheep provide 3. Larger animals like horses and cattle provide up to 4.</p>

               <h3 id="BlushofLife">Blush of Life</h3>
               <p>By spending a point of vitae, kindred may become functionally human for a scene. They become warm with a full pulse. They are able to keep down food and drink 
               (ejecting it at a later time), perform coitus, and pass medical inspection.</p>
               <h3 id="KindredSense">Kindred Sense</h3>
               <p>Kindred have a specially honed sense for blood. They can smell blood from a distance of ten meters per Blood Potency. They can hear a beating heart from
               a third of that distance. They can identify blood seen even in small quantities (in a carpet for example). They can recognize the scent of blood they've tasted 
               previously.</p>
               <p>Without a means to mask or suppress their presence, kindred perceive other vampires as their own kind. All kindred can easily identify another by their unbreathing,
                  unpulsing countenance, their subtle predatory nature, and the scent of mingled blood.</p>
               <h3 id="PhysicalIntensity">Physical Intensity</h3>
               <p>With vitae, any kindred can accomplish massive bursts of physical prowess. By spending a point of vitae, one 
                  may add two dice to rolls involving their choice of strength, dexterity, or stamina for the turn. This does not increase
                  traits derived from these attributes. However, it will increase relevant resistances.</p>
               <h3 id="PredatoryAura">Predatory Aura</h3>
               <p>The Beast is a palpable thing, to its host as to its prey. A kindred's presence radiates power, instantly recognized by not only other kindred, but many
                  other undead and creatures of darkness.
               </p>
               <p>Kindred may lash out with their aura, taking one of three forms:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><b>Monstrous.</b> You are the destroyer, compelling prey to flee. Roll Blood Potency + Strength.</li>
                  <li><b>Hypnotic.</b> You are the tempter, compelling fools to acquiesce. Roll Blood Potency + Presence.</li>
                  <li><b>Dominant.</b> You are the master, compelling the weak to submit. Roll Blood Potency + Intelligence.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Any witness may spend 1 willpower to contest with an appropriate power attribute + Blood Potency. The victor gains a +2 die bonus to any roll to pursue 
                  their interests against the other for the rest of the scene.</p>
               <h3 id="Regeneration">Regeneration</h3>
               <p>Kindred blood seeks to return a vampire to the state of their Embrace. Kindred can spend vitae to revert their body, or allow it to happen unconsciously during
               slumber. A single point of vitae heals two points of bashing damage or one point of lethal damage. A single aggravated wound requires 5 vitae and a full 
               12 hours of slumber.</p>
               <p>A wound or mark can be deliberately preserved by spending willpower. This is often done with piercings or tattoos.</p>
