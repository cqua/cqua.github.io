        <h2 id="TheBlackMiasma">The Black Miasma</h2>
        <p>
        When the duskshards set for the night, a darkness pervades thicker than a Dusker would ever know. They call it the Miasma.
        </p>
        <p>
        It feels like its a freezing wind blowing right through you- as if the darkness was a rushing river, your body a stone at the bottom, and your soul a weak, clinging algae. It snuffs out fire and dulls coals. You feel sharpness all across your skin, like a million needles trying to break through. It loves the smell of blood too- it will seek out any open wounds and tear them further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it will lie to you. The darkness tells you there are enemies and onlookers just outside your sight. It will tell you they have to die. And in this cold, dark night, wouldn't a flash of pain- a pouring of blood- prove a comforting warmth?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the force that creates the abominations. It twists the mind towards death and violence, and twist the body to accomplish those ends. The only way to fight it is the one light it cannot snuff- an electroplasmic lamp.
        </p>
        <p>
        Don't go out at night.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="YourHoldout">Your Holdout</h2>
        <p>
          Your Holdout is divided into zones. You can move to an adjacent zone on your turn, and generally you must be in the same zone as anything you interact with.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ZoneFeatures">Zone Features</h3>
        <p>
          The following are descriptors a zone may have:
        </p>
        <h4 id="Burning">Burning</h4>
        <p>At end of round, each PC in a burning zone must succeed a Finesse roll or suffer Burned (Level-1 Harm). Each NPC suffers Burned (Level-1 Harm).</p>
        <h4 id="Cluttered">Cluttered</h4>
        <p>All Finesse rolls made in cluttered zones are made with -1d.</p>
        <h4 id="Cramped">Cramped</h4>
        <p>All attack rolls and Finesse rolls made in cramped zones are made with -1d.</p>
        <h4 id="Dark">Dark</h4>
        <p>All Grit, Finesse, and Sense rolls made in a dark zone are made with -3d.</p>
        <h4 id="Miasma">Miasma</h4>
        <p>All rolls made in a miasma zone have -1 effect. At end of round, each PC in a miasma zone must succeed a Grit roll or suffer Harrowed (Level-1 Harm).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="TheDeathlandAbominations">The Deathland Abominations</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="PreparationPhase">Preparation Phase</h2>
        <p>
          While the sky is yet orange, once all PCs have returned to the Holdout, it is time to prepare.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Fuel">Fuel</h3>
        <p>
          In order to provide safety, the generator must be fueled. The generator consumes fuel depending on how much power is being used- in general, 1 Supply can power one lamp for 4 hours. Power can be specifically rerouted to and from lamps to conserve power or to alter the battlefield; this can be done during any phase.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Traps">Traps</h3>
        <p>Spend 1 supply to coat a zone with fuel. Light as an action, roll each turn it burns.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="HiddenPhase">Hidden Phase</h2>
        <p>This phase ends when a PC is seen. Every round in the Hidden Phase is equivalent to 6 rounds in the Holdout Phase. Whenever moving from one zone to another, roll Finesse.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="HoldoutPhase">Holdout Phase</h2>
        <h3 id="RoundStructure">Round Structure</h3>
        <p>
          Each round progresses in order:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Top of Round.</b> Each PC chooses "Fast Turn" or "Slow Turn".</li>
          <li><b>PC Fast Turns.</b> Each PC who chose "Fast Turn" may take one full action <b>or</b> one movement. PCs take turns simultaneously.</li>
          <li><b>Enemy Fast Turns.</b> Each enemy taking a fast turn acts.</li>
          <li><b>PC Slow Turns.</b> Each PC who did not act during fast turns
            may take one full action <b>and</b> one movement. PCs take turns simultaneously.</li>
          <li><b>Enemy Slow Turns.</b> Each enemy which did not take a fast turn acts.</li>
          <li><b>End of Round.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="PlayerActions">Player Actions</h3>
        <p>
          Actions are divided into <b>Full Actions</b> and <b>Quick Actions</b>. All creatures are limited in how many Full Actions they can take in one round, but can take as many Quick Actions as they want. Full Actions can only be performed while no other creature is declaring or resolving an action or movement, wheras Quick Actions can <b>interrupt</b> other actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a creature declares an full action, quick action, or movement, all players and the GM may <b>interrupt</b> and declare a Quick Action. The quick action resolves first, then the triggering action or movement resolves. If two or more players interrupt at the same time, they make a Finesse roll to determine who goes first.
        </p>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>When a player takes a movement, they move to an adjacent zone.</p>
        <h3>Full Actions</h3>
        <p>
          Players can use their full actions to attack, use gear, or interact with objects.
        </p>
        <h3>Attacking</h3>
        <p>
          To make an attack, declare the target(s) and weapon(s) used. Make a Grit Check, taking account of bonuses and penalties from weapon choice, target, and environment. On a success, the target takes harm with level equal to your effect. On a mixed success, you suffer the weapon's listed consequence.  All weapons by default have 0 effect, and the default consequence is "You are Left Open (attacks against you get +d until your next turn)".
        </p>
        <h3>Quick Actions</h3>
        <p><b>Surge</b> Spend 1 Momentum and perform 1 Full Action immediately. The action cannot require more than 10 seconds. Actions that can be chosen include attacking, setting a simple trap, or surveying a field. Activate only once per turn.</p>
        <p><b>Dash</b> Spend 1 Momentum and perform 1 Movement immediately. Activate only once per turn.</p>
        <p><b>Dodge</b> Spend 1 Momentum after being attacked by a creature and receive no harm from the attack. Activate only once per turn.</p>
