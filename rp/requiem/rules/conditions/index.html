               <p>The list below includes common Conditions that can be
               applied to characters. For Skill-based rolls, an exceptional success allows the noted Condition (unless otherwise stated). It
               may go to your character, or to the subject of the roll, as noted.</p>
               <p>Temporary conditions last until the resolution is met, at which point the character clears the condition and takes a beat. Temporary
                  conditions will also fade away when appropriate, usually after a scene, but the character does not take a beat this way. Persistent
                  conditions require greater effort to end depending on the specifics of the situation. They can still be resolved once per chapter to
                  take a beat, but this will usually not end the condition.

               <h2 id="TemporaryConditions">Temporary Conditions</h2>
               <h3 id="Blind">Blind</h3>
               <p>Your character cannot see. Any rolls requiring sight may
                  only use a chance die. If another sense can be reasonably substituted, make the roll at -3 instead.</p>
               <p>This Condition may be taken as Persistent.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Limitation or difficulty that heightens immediate danger.</p>
               <h3 id="Bonded">Bonded</h3>
               <p>Your character has established an extensive bond with an
               animal. They gain +2 on any rolls to influence or persuade the
               animal once per scene. The animal may add your Animal Ken
               to any rolls to remain loyal in the face of coercion or fear. The animal may add your character’s Animal Ken
               to any one die roll.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> The bonded animal dies.</p>
               <h3 id="Confused">Confused</h3>
               <p>Your character cannot think straight, either because of some mental power or good old-fashioned cranial trauma. You take
               a –2 die penalty on all Intelligence and Wits rolls. </p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Take any amount of lethal damage.</p>
               <h3 id="Connected">Connected</h3>
               <p>Your character has made inroads with a specified group.
               While they have this Condition, they get a +2 to all rolls relating to that group. Alternately, they can shed this Condition
               to gain a one-time +3 bonus to influence or otherwise work
               with the group.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Condition shed, bridge burned.</p>
               <h3 id="Deprived">Deprived</h3>
               <p>Your character suffers from an addiction, and is unable to focus and contain
                  themself. Remove one die from Stamina, Resolve, and Composure dice pools. This does not influence derived traits;
                  it simply influences dice pools that use these Attributes.</p>
               <p>This Condition may be taken as Persistent.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Indulge in the deprived Vice.</p>
               <h3 id='Drained'>Drained</h3>
               <p>Your character has suffered extensive blood loss. They suffer a –2 die penalty to any physical actions,
               and rolls to stabilize and survive injuries. As well, after any scene where they exert themself physically, they must make a Stamina roll
               or fall unconscious for an hour or more. The Drained penalty does not apply to the Stamina roll, but any wound penalties do
               apply. Taking damage, being fed from, or spending Willpower on a physical roll applies as physical exertion for this Condition.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> All lethal damage healed through normal means</p>
               <h3 id='Guilty'>Guilty</h3>
               <p>Your character is experiencing deep-seated feelings of guilt and remorse. This Condition is commonly applied after a
               successful breaking point roll. While the character is under the effects of this Condition, they receive a -2 to any Resolve
               or Composure rolls to defend against Subterfuge, Empathy, or Intimidation rolls.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> The character makes restitution for whatever was done; the character confesses their crimes.</p>
               <h3 id='Inspired'>Inspired</h3>
               <p>Your character is deeply inspired. When your character takes an action pertaining to that inspiration, you may resolve
               this Condition. Gain a Willpower point, and consider the roll an Exceptional Success on three successes, instead of five.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Use the Condition for its benefit.</p>
               <h3 id='Mesmerized'>Mesmerized</h3>
               <p>Your character’s will is subordinate to that of a greater power. You’re not obviously hypnotized — you’re a bit quiet and reserved compared
               to normal, but nothing out of the ordinary. When the power who inflicted this Condition gives you a command, you cannot resist. If
               it’s something that you wouldn’t normally do, you might look like you’ve been hypnotized or that you’re sleepwalking, but otherwise
               you look and act normally. If you resolve this Condition, gain a +3 die bonus to resist further attempts to Mesmerize you in the
               same scene; you also can’t quite remember what happened while you were under the spell.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Take more bashing or lethal damage than your Stamina. Experience a breaking point when following the
               command, and succeed at the related Resolve + Composure roll. Follow the command.</p>
               <h3 id='Sated'>Sated</h3>
               <p>Your character gave their vice an outlet. Until they resolve this Condition, they have
               a +1 die modifier to rolls to resist their urges.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Succumb to vice, or resist a significant provocation.</p>
               <h3 id="Scarred">Scarred</h3>
               <p>Your character was subject to a violent event and left disturbed, angry, paranoid, and prone to lashing out. With
                  this Condition, take a –2 die penalty to any rolls to resist fear. As well, any creature exhibiting a predatory aura attempting to
                  frighten or intimidate your character receives a +2 die bonus.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Lash out physically, causing three or more levels of lethal damage to someone.</p>
               <h3 id='Shaken'>Shaken</h3>
               <p>Something has frightened your character extensively.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Any time your character is taking an action where that fear might
               hinder, you may opt to fail the roll (before you’ve made the roll)</p>
               <h3 id='Spooked'>Spooked</h3>
               <p>Your character has seen something supernatural — not overt enough to terrify, but unmistakably otherworldly.
               How your character responds to this is up to you, but it captivates and eats their attention.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Your character’s fear and fascination causes them to do something that hinders the group or complicates things 
                  (going off alone to investigate a strange noise, staying up all night researching, running away instead of holding their ground).</p>
               <h3 id="Steadfast">Steadfast</h3>
               <p>Your character is confident and resolved. When you’ve failed a roll, resolve this Condition to instead treat the action
               as if you’d rolled a single success. If the roll was a chance die, you may resolve this Condition and roll a single die instead.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Use the Condition for its benefit.</p>
               <h3 id="Swooning">Swooning</h3>
               <p>Your character is attracted to someone and is vulnerable
               where they are concerned. They may have the proverbial
               butterflies in their stomach, or just be constantly aware of their
               object of affection. They suffer a -2 to any rolls that would adversely
               affect the specified character, who also gains +2 on any Social rolls against your character.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> Do something for their love that puts your character in danger; opt to fail a roll to resist a social action by the object.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <h2 id="PersistentConditions">Persistent Conditions</h2>
               <h3 id='Amnesia'>Amnesia</h3>
               <p>Your character is missing a portion of memory. An entire period of their life is just gone. This causes massive difficulties
               with friends and loved ones.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b>  Something problematic arises, such as a forgotten arrest
                  warrant or old enemy.</p>
               <h3 id='Charmed'>Charmed</h3>
               <p>You’ve been charmed by a supernatural force of personality. You don’t want to believe that anything it says is a
               lie, and you can’t read its true intentions.</p>
               <p><b>Resolution:</b> You divulge a secret or perform a favor for the entity.</p>
