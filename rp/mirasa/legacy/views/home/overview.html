			<h3>Basic Rules</h3>
			<h2>Boons & Banes</h2>
		<p>
			Circumstances can make d20 rolls easier or harder. Positive circumstances grant one or more boons, while negative circumstances impose one or more banes.
		</p><p>
			Boons improve your d20 die rolls. One or more boons might apply to a given roll. For each boon, you roll a d6 and then add the highest number rolled on all the boon dice to d20 roll. For example, if you make a d20 roll with 3 boons, you would roll 3d6. Say you get 1, 4, and 6 on those dice. The 6 is the highest number, so you add 6 to your d20 roll.
		</p><p>
			Banes hinder your d20 die rolls. One or more banes might apply to a given roll. For each bane, you roll a d6 and then subtract the highest number on all the bane dice from your d20 roll. For example, if you make a d20 roll with 4 banes, you would roll 4d6. Say you get 1, 3, 5, and 5 on those dice. Since 5 is the highest number, you would subtract 5 from your d20 roll.
		</p><p>
			Boons and banes cancel each other out, one for one. If 2 boons and 1 bane apply to a particular d20 roll, you make the roll with 1 boon (1 bane cancels 1 boon). Similarly, if 2 boons and 4 banes apply to the roll, you would end up making the roll with 2 banes (2 boons cancel 2 banes).
