		<h1>WITCH</h1>

		<p>
			Witchcraft is as old as humanity. With roots in faerie magic,
witchcraft represents the first attempts to understand and
tame the magic in the world. Early practitioners blended
their efforts to control magic with religious belief, and that
mingling remains with its practitioners today.
		</p>
		<p>
Witches command great magical power but do so
through religious customs and ceremonies handed down
through the centuries. Witches who began their training
as priests see their art as an expression of their faith, while
those who began as magicians often take a more scholarly
approach to their religious practices.
		</p>
		<p>
Witches adopt a peculiar style of dress. Men and women
both favor dark garments of homespun, cloaks, sturdy
boots for walking, and tall, pointed hats.
