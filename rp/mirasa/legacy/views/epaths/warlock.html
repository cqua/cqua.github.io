			Warlocks, called oath-breakers by some, are counted by
wizards as the most despicable of the users of magic, for
they come by their power by underhanded means. Rather
than study ancient texts or pledge their lives to a god or
gods, warlocks steal their magic from anyone and everyone
they can, be they dread agents of the underworld or from
the minds of rival casters. With the talents and techniques
to do so, warlocks take whatever power they want from
whoever they wish.
		</p>
		<p>
Most warlocks come from magical backgrounds, having
at least dabbled in magic. They include has-been or failed
magicians, defrocked priests, or even rogues who managed
to learn a few tricks. Whatever their origins, they pursue
magical knowledge in fell places, making deals with devils,
faeries, or any other being who might bestow on them
the knowledge they crave. Not content with the gains they
make through their bargains, warlocks eventually learn
techniques to take spells from others directly. All they need
to do is witness the spell being cast and they can pluck
it from the air, causing the original spell to fizzle out and
enabling them with the ability to cast it themselves.
