		<h1>PALADIN</h1>

		<p>
			Holy warriors possessed of great courage and determination,
paladins take the fight to darkness, waging war eternal
against the forces of wickedness and unrest threatening to
upset the foundation on which civilization stands. Most
paladins hear their gods calling them to take up arms and
join the struggle against demons and foul monsters. Others
take up the paladin’s life out of a sense of obligation, concern
over troubling events, or from a need for vengeance against
those who have brought ruin to the world.
		</p>
		<p>
Any religion or faith can produce paladins. Paladins
affiliated with the cult of the New God might be temple
guardians, valiant crusaders, or even inquisitors. Those with
ties to the Old Faith rely on Nature and Primal magic to give
them strength against their foes. And there are even some
paladins with ties to witchcraft who take on the role as a
coven’s protector or a witch’s guardian.
