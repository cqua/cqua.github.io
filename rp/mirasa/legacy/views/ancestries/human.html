		<p>
			Humans were the first mortal beings. After the demons were banished to Hell, leaving mankind to rule the mortal realm, unity was found in the Eryth Empire. However, the past 200 years have greeted humankind with dissent and upheaval, climaxing with the black sorcery of the Demon Lordâ€™s Shadow, which destroyed the capital city and left the rest of mankind to form a vast array of city states.

		<p>
			<b>Many Variations</b> Humans comprise many different ethnic groups. Skin tones can range from almost black to albino white, or green, blue, orange, pink, or something else. Some humans have patterned skin, stripes, thick body hair, or no hair at all. Humans also have many different shapes and sizes. They range from 3 to 7 feet tall and weigh from 50 to 500 pounds or more. Most humans live about 70 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ubuntu</b> There is no Eryth culture- neighboring city states have distinct cultures, and while outsiders regularly confuse them, most humans take great offense to being associated with a different city state. The four largest stand in the cardinal directions. In the east stands tall the stronghold-city Cairn, ready for any invasion. In the west the tinkerers and mages of Oeda <span class='span_subtitle'>(Sounds like Way-da)</span> float through the air. The halls of Torig built by the ancient jotunn to the north are now inhabited by vagabonds and defectors, who have built their own society of misfits in the cold. The port city Waterkeen to the south is home to the church of the new God Amaat.
