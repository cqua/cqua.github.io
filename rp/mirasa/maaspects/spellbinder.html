				To even the odds against the iron-wielding trolls, the faeries
	devised the art of spellbinding, a technique that allowed
	them to channel magical energy into their weapons. Armed
	with bronze swords limned in eldritch flames and bows
	capable of loosing empowered arrows, the spellbinders
	could cut through their enemies’ defenses, driving back or
	outright destroying their monstrous creations. Ultimately,
	spellbinding proved to be one of the most significant
	weapons used in the defeat of the hated trolls and their
	unspeakable armies. For centuries thereafter, the faeries
	guarded the secrets of spellbinding from other peoples to
	ensure their magic could not be used against them. It is
	not known whether it was revealed by unscrupulous fey or
	simply discovered by non-fey on their own, but eventually
	the spellbinding tradition became known by almost all
	peoples on Rûl.
			</p>
			<p>
	The heart of spellbinding lies in a single spell, one which
	allows casters to imbue their weapons with magical energy
	that binds the weapon to them and enhances the weapon’s
	deadliness. Spellbinders can call their empowered weapon
	to hand with a command, reassemble the weapon from
	fragments, and use the weapon as their implement to
	cast other spells. In time, spellbinders learn to channel
	even more magic through the weapon, making them truly
	formidable combatants.
