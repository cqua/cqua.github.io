				Assassins specialize in the art of murder. They learn the
	best ways to speed their victims to the grave, whether using
	a strangling cord, poison in a cup, or a knife slid between
	the ribs. Assassins avoid fair fights, preferring to skulk in
	the shadows, where they can watch for the perfect time to
	strike. They might spend weeks or even months gathering
	information about their victims, learning all they can to
	overcome their defenses and to attack when their targets
	are least prepared.
			</p>
			<p>
	Most assassins take contracts to eliminate specific targets.
	Assassins can be freelancers or members of a secret society
	of professional killers, such as the Black Hand. For them,
	killing is nothing more than upholding their end of a
	business transaction. Of course, others come to this path for
	a variety of reasons. Some are simply cold-blooded killers,
	spies, or even skilled snipers. A few belong to death cults
	who see each kill as a prayer offered to the sinister power
	they serve.
