				Bards have great skill as performers, but they are no mere minstrels. Their mastery of Song magic gives them many advantages when interacting with others. They can draw from the songs and poems they learn to gain clues about the world around them, and weave magic into their music to manipulate their audiences, whether to inspire them or demoralize them. Bards are highly sought the world over for their skills and expertise, and find welcome almost anywhere they go.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ever dabblers, these jacks-of-all-trades know a little about everything but not a lot about any one thing. An aspect attractive to tricksters and adventurers, its talents help them find solutions to almost any problem and find a way to succeed when they should fail.
			</p>
			<p>
				Skills, cunning, and luck enable bards to do what they do and thus many scouts begin their training as rogues. The tricks and talents they gain as rogues serve them well when slipping off to chart a course ahead. Many warriors find the bardâ€™s path appealing since it lets them diversify their talents beyond trading blows on the battlefield, and they have the toughness to take a few hits if the situation goes wrong. Priests might follow this path because the talents are useful for protecting their territory and monitoring its borders for enemy movement.
