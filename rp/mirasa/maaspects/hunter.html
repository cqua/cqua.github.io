				The first line of defense against the darkness outside the
	civilized lands, hunters prowl the wilderness, always on the
	move, never staying in one place for too long. Consummate
	survivors, hunters know how to get along in the wild. They
	know how to find water, what foods to forage, and how to hunt
	and trap game. Whether they climb the trackless mountains
	or stalk through the deepest forests, hunters are no more in
	their element than when they are in the midst of the wilds.
			</p>
			<p>
	The hunter’s life is one of isolation. Many feel called to
	set out into the most dangerous lands, where they wage war
	against the monstrosities that pose the direst threat to ordinary
	people. Others have cut ties to their homeland, preferring
	to keep their own company to the crowds and stench of the
	cities. Most hunters see it as their duty to protect the natural
	places and those who struggle to make a life on the frontier,
	though some feel no obligation to the world, and might
	even join forces with other wild things to curb civilization’s
	encroachment upon the untamed lands.
			</p>
			<p>
	Hunters come from all backgrounds. Warriors might
	become hunters after fighting monsters in the wild or blazing
	trails into unknown lands, while rogues might develop hunter
	talents after being outlaws or bandits forced out of urban
	environments. Many priests of the Old Faith and magicians
	focused on Nature and Primal magic become hunters to
	champion their gods or to deepen their connection to the
	natural world.
