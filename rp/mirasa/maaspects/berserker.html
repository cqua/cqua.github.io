			<p>
	A vital energy for those in the thick of battle, anger enables a
	combatant to push through extreme pain and injury in order
	to return it twofold to those who dealt it. For berserkers,
	anger is more than just an emotion: it is a living thing always
	raging within them, desperate to be unleashed, always
	rattling the cage of self-control containing it. So when a
	berserker’s temper slips—even by a little—all the rage,
	hatred, and frustration boils out to transform the warrior into
	a wild killer, a bloodthirsty brute seeking nothing but the
	utter destruction of any foe who dares to stand before them.
			</p>
			<p>
	The transformative power of a berserker’s rage might come
	from a variety of sources. Many are simply unbalanced,
	having witnessed so many awful things that they now snap
	under the pressure. Some have divine or supernatural causes
	for their anger; for example, dwarf berserkers believe they
	are taken over by one of their ancestor spirits. Others might
	be haunted by spirits or, worse, demons, and when they
	surrender to their anger, the entity haunting or possessing
	them takes over.

			<h3>CORE BERSERKER</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Attributes</b> Increase two by 1<br/>
				<b>Characteristics</b> Health +6
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Frenzy</b> If you are not fatigued when you take damage, you can choose to frenzy. If you frenzy, you gain all of the following benefits and drawbacks for 1 minute or until you become unconscious.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a +10 bonus to Health.</li>
				<li>You cannot be charmed, compelled, or frightened.</li>
				<li>You make attack rolls with 1 bane.</li>
				<li>Your attacks with weapons deal 2d6 extra damage.</li>
				<li>You must take a fast turn whenever possible, and use an action on each of your turns to attack, relying on a charge if necessary.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When your frenzy ends, you become fatigued for 1 minute and you must get a success on a Will challenge roll or gain 1 Beasthood.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Fury Unleashed</b> If you would roll on the Beasthood Table, you frenzy instead, even if you are fatigued. While you frenzy in this way, the GM controls your character. At the end of each round, the GM rolls a d6. On a 5 or higher, your frenzy ends and you reduce your Beasthood total by 1d6 + your Will modifier (minimum 0). You then become fatigued for 1 minute. If you were already fatigued, you instead take 1d6 damage.

			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Frightful Wrath</b>  When you frenzy, each creature within short range who is not a member of your group must get a success on a Will challenge roll or become frightened for 1 round.
