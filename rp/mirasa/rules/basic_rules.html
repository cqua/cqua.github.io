				"A roleplaying game is a conversation between the GM and the players, punctuated by dice rolls to inject uncertainty and surprising turns.
			</p>
			<p>
				"The GM presents the fictional situation in which the player characters find themselves. The players determine the actions of their characters in response to the situation. The GM and the players together judge how the game systems are engaged. The outcomes of the mechanics then change the situation, leading into a new phase of the conversation—new situations, new actions, new judgments, new rolls—creating an ongoing fiction and building “the story” of the game, organically, from a series of discrete moments.
			</p>
			<p>
				"<b>No one is in charge of the story.</b> The story is what happens as a result of the situation presented by the GM, the actions the characters take, the outcomes of the mechanics, and the consequences that result. The story emerges from the unpredictable collision of all of these elements. You <b>play to find out</b> what the story will be."

				Similar to other tabletop games, Shadow of the Demon Lord uses a twenty-sided die (d20) to resolve conflicts. Rolls are Rolls are divided into challenge rolls and attack rolls. In most cases, a roll is done by rolling a d20, adding a specified attribute depending on the situation (Strength, Agility, Intellect, Will, Perception), and comparing the result with the target. The result must meet or exceed the target to be a success. For challenge rolls, the target is always 12. For attack rolls, the target is the attacked creature's defense, unless otherwise specified. Circumstances can make d20 rolls easier or harder. Positive circumstances grant one or more boons, while negative circumstances impose one or more banes.
			</p>
			<h3>Boons & Banes</h3>
			<p>
				Boons improve your d20 die rolls. One or more boons might apply to a given roll. For each boon, you roll a d6 and then add the highest number rolled on all the boon dice to d20 roll. For example, if you make a d20 roll with 3 boons, you would roll 3d6. Say you get 1, 4, and 6 on those dice. The 6 is the highest number, so you add 6 to your d20 roll.
			</p><p>
				Banes hinder your d20 die rolls. One or more banes might apply to a given roll. For each bane, you roll a d6 and then subtract the highest number on all the bane dice from your d20 roll. For example, if you make a d20 roll with 4 banes, you would roll 4d6. Say you get 1, 3, 5, and 5 on those dice. Since 5 is the highest number, you would subtract 5 from your d20 roll.
			</p><p>
				Boons and banes cancel each other out, one for one. If 2 boons and 1 bane apply to a particular d20 roll, you make the roll with 1 boon (1 bane cancels 1 boon). Similarly, if 2 boons and 4 banes apply to the roll, you would end up making the roll with 2 banes (2 boons cancel 2 banes).
