		<h1>GEOMANCER</h1>
		<p>
			Only those who forge bonds with earth genies can wield the power of Earth magic. Geomancers go a step farther, bridging the distance between themselves and their companion to gain even greater control over earth and stone. Such a connection escalates the physical transformation resulting from their bond; geomancers lose all their body hair, and their skin assumes the appearance of stone, whether smooth or pebbled, unbroken or fissured.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 7 GEOMANCER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Attributes</b> Increase three by 1<br/>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +4, Power +1<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You discover the Earth tradition or learn one Earth spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Earthen Defense</b> You can use an action to expend a casting of an Earth spell of rank 1 or higher. Roll a d6 for each rank of the spell and total the numbers rolled. The total becomes your Earthen Defense, a pool of points used to absorb damage. While your Earthen Defense pool has at least 1 point, when you take damage, subtract the damage from the pool first and then take any damage that remains. The effect lasts until the pool drops to 0 points, you use this talent again, or you complete a rest.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 10 GEOMANCER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +4<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Earth Walker</b> You ignore the effects of moving across difficult terrain made from earth, sand, or stone. In addition, you can move through spaces occupied by earth, sand, or stone. If you end your movement inside a solid space, you are moved back to an open space nearest to the point where you entered that space.
		</p>
		<h1>HEALER</h1>
		<p>
			The Life tradition offers spells that enable healing and curing. Thus, the tradition is sought by those who wish to bring aid and comfort to those in need. Healers commit themselves to tending others’ hurts, to the exclusion of other pursuits, and typically come from a background dedicated to helping others. Such is their power that when they walk through a room, wounds close, diseases vanish, and poisons become harmless.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 7 HEALER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Attributes</b> Increase three by 1<br/>

		<p>
			<b>Unassailable Vitality</b> You never take damage from disease or poison, and you cannot become diseased or poisoned. In addition, you heal all damage when you complete a rest.
		</p>
		<h1>HEXER</h1>
		<p>
			The vile art of Curse magic underpins hexers’ power. Delighting in the misfortune and suffering they create, hexers use spells to warp their enemies and strip away their vitality. Many discovered the Curse tradition as warlocks and witches and exult in the power the tradition offers them.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h1>HYDROMANCER</h1>
		<p>
			Developing their bond to water genies allows hydromancers to cast Water spells to greater effect and to gain greater benefits from their connections. Studying the tradition reveals its potential in battle, both in the effects its spells create and the subtle transformations they make. Most hydromancers have nautical backgrounds or spent considerable time on or under the ocean.

		</p>

			<li>You take half damage from weapons.</li>
			<li>You cannot become grabbed, immobilized, knocked prone, or slowed.</li>
			<li>You are invisible while you are submerged in water.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>ILLUSIONIST</h1>
		<p>
			The line between reality and illusion blurs around illusionists. These masters of Illusion magic fabricate lifelike simulacra of creatures and intense bursts of energy, or reshape their environments to suit their needs. A great many illusionists come from the ranks of magicians, though a few began as rogues, developing their magical skills to pull off daring schemes.
		</p>

		<h1>INVOKER</h1>
		<p>
			The invoker lays bare the secrets of Invocation magic, learning how to command the daemons she binds with great efficiency and effect. Having grown accustomed to the mental trauma that comes from from invoking daemons, the invoker can deepen her knowledge of the tradition without fear of going mad. In time, invokers can break all the rules for binding daemons, enabling them to adapt to almost any situation.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h1>MAGE KNIGHT</h1>
		<p>
			Magic from the Battle tradition turns casters into deadly warriors. Mage knights use the spells from their preferred tradition to enhance their already formidable combat training and to increase options in a fight. Opponents squaring off against them never know if they’ll face a strike from a weapon or a blast from a spell.
		</p>

		<h1>MAGUS</h1>
		<p>
			Members of a secret cabal of magic-users, the magi identify their membership by the magical staffs they carry. The order traces its origins to the founding of the Tower Arcane, drifting through the sky above the Empire’s capital, when members broke from the august assembly to forge their own paths in the world. Potential candidates to join the magi must demonstrate their magical knowledge by presenting an argument about the theory of magic, display their ability to cast a spell, and, most important, complete the construction of a magical staff.
