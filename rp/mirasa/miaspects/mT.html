		<h1>TECHNOMANCER</h1>
		<p>
			Technomancers exploit the merging of magic with technology that’s made possible by the Technomancy tradition to create even more powerful devices to aid them on their expeditions. With a few moments of work, they can fashion useful inventions to help them perform certain activities and can eventually create automata from ordinary objects.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 7 TECHNOMANCER</h3>

			<b>Attributes</b> Increase three by 1<br/>

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Invention</b> When you cast a Technomancy spell, you also create a device you can hold in one hand that’s imbued with magical power that lasts until you expend it or until you complete a rest. When you make an attack roll or a challenge roll, you can expend the power from the device to make the roll with 1 boon.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h1>TENEBRIST</h1>
		<p>
			The Shadow tradition, while not technically dark magic, has a sinister reputation for infecting its practitioners with darkness. Undaunted by the risks, tenebrists embrace all that Shadow offers. Its effects typically manifest as a waxy pallor, a darkening of the eyes, and a thinness of the body.
		</p>

			<b>Shadow Form</b> Use an action or a triggered action on your turn and expend a casting of a Rank 1 or higher spell to become shadowy and indistinct for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Creatures attacking your Defense or Agility make the attack roll with 1 bane, and on a failure, you can use a triggered action to move up to your Speed. This movement does not trigger free attacks.</li>
			<li>You are invisible while you are in areas obscured by shadows or darkness.</li>
			<li>When moving, you can move through spaces occupied by other creatures.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>THAUMATURGE</h1>
		<p>
			Chaos magic is so unpredictable that many who learn spells avoid the tradition and those who study it. Thaumaturges throw caution to the wind and embrace Chaos for all it offers, heedless of the risks and perils its spells create. Nearly all thaumaturges are a little unhinged.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 7 THAUMATURGE</h3>

			<b>Attributes</b> Increase three by 1<br/>

		</p>
		<h1>THEURGE</h1>
		<p>
			Found almost exclusively among the ranks of the New God’s followers, theurges claim a direct line to their deity, invoking power from their patron to fight against the Demon Lord and its horrid servants. Most theurges occupy positions of great honor and reverence in their religions, though the Inquisition deems the few renegade theurges at large to be as dangerous as the Demon Lord’s disciples for the heretical positions they hold, foremost of which is a denial that the New God exists at all.
		</p>

A pulse of energy spreads out a number of yards from a point you can reach equal to 1 + the spell’s rank. Each creature you choose in the area must get a success on a Will challenge roll or become frightened until the end of the round. If a creature that gets a failure is already frightened, it instead becomes stunned until the end of the round.
		</p>
		<h1>TRANSMUTER</h1>
		<p>
			Transmuters discover the mutable nature of all things through the advanced study of Alteration magic. Like their capabilities, they are changeable in their views and emotions, swinging from love to hate, laughter to tears, with little warning or reason.
		</p>

			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2, Power +1<br/>

			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You learn one spell.

		<h1>TRAVELER</h1>

If the target can no longer attack you, its action is wasted. 
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 10 TRAVELER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Far Traveler</b> When you teleport from casting a Teleportation spell, you increase the range of the spell from short to medium, medium to long, or long to extreme.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Spatial Disturbance</b> Whenever you cast a Teleportation spell, all creatures that can see you treat you as if you were in an area that is partially obscured. The effect lasts for 1 minute.
		</p>
		<h1>WOODWOSE</h1>
		<p>
			Having vowed to protect the land, woodwoses call upon power from the natural world to carry out their obligations. Woodwoses lose much of the appearance gained from their ancestries, becoming more plantlike over time. Their skin becomes like bark, their eyes shine with emerald light, and new leaves sprout across their bodies.
		</p>

You remain aware of your surroundings and can make Perception rolls. You can’t do anything else other than end the effect, which you can do at any time using a triggered action. You resume your normal form if you become incapacitated while in this form. If you rest while in this form, you heal all damage at the end of the rest.
