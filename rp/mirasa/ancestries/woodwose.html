			The ancestors of the woodwose made an ancient contract with the woods, to be its guardian.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Verdant Vitality</b> The woodwose flesh mimics wood and bark- it tends to be tough and cold to the touch. Their bark can be any number of patterns, resembling fir or birch or maple. Woodwose can eat a wide variety of things, since rather than digesting, their bodies drain the nutrients. This means they can eat most plant and animal matter, as well as soil and wood (of course, eating any of these things live is a serious taboo). Woodwose will continue to grow for as long as they live. Most reach about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds by 100 years, at which point they die of old age. Many live long past that, continuing to grow larger.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Scattered Leaves</b> Woodwose tend to be solitary creatures, wandering the wood, protecting it from destructive forces such as humans and fire. Some woodwose live their entire lives never speaking a word to another mortal. However, some woodwose choose to befriend or even integrate into human or elven society.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Common Names</b> Woodwose outside of society have no use for names. When a woodwose is given or takes a name, it often describes their appearance, or a concept that is important to them. Some common ones are: Alba, Autumn, Estuary, Hallow, Leaf, Oak, Solstice, Sprig, Sycamore, Quercus, Willow
