		<p>
			 Believed to be descended from fae-touched humans, elves live in a grand kingdom of trees, glass, and magic in the forest.
		</p>
		<p>
			Elves are humanlike, if significantly more thin and agile. They have a long series of social rules for etiquette that most elves follow thoughtlessly, but which often takes a lifetime for other ancestries to pick up. They stand 5 to 8 foot tall and weigh 50 to 300 pounds when fully grown. Elves usually live around 300 years, but are considered mature at 40 years. Elves' sexual dimorphism is very difficult to identify, and many non-elves assume they do not have it. Following, it's a tradition in many elven societies to choose your gender when you come of age.
		</p>
		<p>
			Where human society often has little regard for nature, elven society seeks to expand with nature. This is both is caused by and leads to their closer connection with mana. Spellcasters are on every street corner, doing mundane such as aiding plant growth or working an elevator.
