			According to legend, the beastfolk's humanity was stripped from them for some long-forgotten crime. Today, they live in small settlements in the forests.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Horn and Claw</b> Beastfolk are usually fur-covered and have the heads of beasts, such as goats, wolves, bears, rats, and bulls. Many have claws, hooves, horns, whiskers, or spots. Most common are the wolf-headed Vargr, who stand 6 to 8 feet tall and weigh 200 to 600 pounds. The rat-headed Ysoki stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, weighing up to 250 pounds while the bull-headed Minotaur reach heights of 10 feet and weigh up to 750 pounds. They rarely live past 50 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Without Homeland</b> Beastfolk gather in wild places: deep forests, empty plains, and abandoned, ruined cities, where they raise their small settlements. The increase of activity in Mirasa has had the most dire consequences for the beastfolk, who have no walls or ballistae to protect them. As such, many beastfolk have recently lost their parents' settlements and have had to integrate into human and elven society.
