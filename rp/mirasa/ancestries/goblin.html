			The Faerie exiled the goblins long ago, for a crime only they remember. As part of their exile, she stripped them of their immortality and doomed them to live out their days in the mortal world. Goblins have since taken up life in human society, usually making their homes in rubbish heaps and sewers where, to everyoneâ€™s surprise, they seem quite happy doing the jobs no one else is at all interested in performing. Picking through trash for choice treasures or trawling the fetid waters oozing through the subterranean tunnels for a bit of gold or a dropped coin is all most goblins need to keep them from making trouble for their neighbors.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Bizarre and Varied Appearance</b> All goblins are short by human standards, but their height is the only thing they have in common. No two goblins look alike. They all have unusual physical characteristics that make them distinct from one another, such as pig snouts in place of noses, fangs, horns, or a profusion of seemingly mobile warts. They don't have any concept of gender, apart from the few who have adopted human customs. Some goblins die of old age at 50 while others have lived 400 years or more.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Weird Habits</b> Many goblins have weird habits. Some keep twigs and bones in small bottles and jars to prevent witches from stealing their names. Others knock on wood when they need a bit of luck, keep odd bits of rubbish as good luck charms, or can never speak for fear of losing their vital essence.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Common Names</b> Goblins are named after objects in nature and tools similar to the faeries of their past- but they tend to lose the charm in translation, resulting in names like Blix, Blunder, Bug, Deek, Frog, Juce, Krixit, Needle, Puck, Sneet, Tick-Tock, Twelves, Wicker, and Vittle.
