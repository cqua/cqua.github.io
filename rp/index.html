								<h2><i>2022, March - July</i> | Dungeons & Dragons: 5th Edition</h2>
							<p>A red dragon recently came to our kingdom and began desolating the countryside. The monster has taken Vendrien Keep as its lair. Vendrien Keep, once owned by a wealthy duke, now rests abandoned deep in the marshlands since its previous inhabitants all went mad.</p>
							<p>The king wants the dragons head, and you all are going to get it.</p>
							<p>There are several other reasons you may disinter this tomb- it houses a robust arcane archive and an ancient holy shrine. But the dragon must die.</p>

							<h2><i>2021, March - July</i> | Shadow of the Demon Lord</h2>
							<p>You are Rangers of the territory surrounding Mirasa, an untamable jungle. Mirasa is an unexplored monster breeding ground, from which emerges new deadlier mutants every year. The rapid rate of mutation is a mystery, but the nearby villages and outposts are under frequent attack by tiger apes, lava lobsters, or turtle-gators.</p>

						<h1 id="illune">The Doors of Illune</h1>
						<div class="thumbed">
						<img src="illune/content/gods.png"></img>
							<h2><i>2021, March - July</i> | Shadow of the Demon Lord</h2>
							<p>While the six Elder Gods saw this as the natural order, Amaat, the new God, challenged this order. In exchange for man's eternal loyalty, Amaat gave them the tools to cast the demons to Hell. With the blessing of the Elder Six, Amaat sentenced men who break their tenets to Hell to be ruled by demons once again.</p>
							<p>For ages, there was peace. But the past centuries of war fought by rightous soldiers and royal sorcerers have left the land scarred. The accursed sorcery that turned the waters black was cast. The Imperial Regent lies dead, her domain shattered. The beastmen spill from their woods to burn the countryside, and the servants of the Archdemons have grown bolder- fueling their masters' return with blood drawn from the many empty battlefields.</p>
							<p>In the eye of the archipelago, the city of Tradegate spreads across a ring of small isles overlooking black waters, connected by a network of bridges. Six pale spires rise above the city, obscured by the perpetual smoke spewing from the stacks of its industrial district. Past the spires lay farmland and forest. In the center of this city stands the Guild of Illune- home to laborers and priests dedicated to rebuilding the archipelago.</p>
							<p><i>The Doors of Illune was a roleplaying game based off of Shadow of the Demon Lord, by Schwalb Entertainment, and the website uses a heavily modified ruleset for the game.</i></p>

						<h2><i>2020, June - October</i> | Dungeons & Dragons: 5th Edition</h2>
							<p>Your characters are each Chosen Champions for your people. You may have been chosen unknowingly or against your will, and you may not (yet) have any idea why you would be chosen.</p>
							<p>Your team will represent your plane of existence, the land of Oraia, and participate in a Tournament for the Gods, against several other planes. Each member of the winning team will be granted a wish by the gods, and your plane will be spared. Planes who fail or are disqualified will be erased.</p>
