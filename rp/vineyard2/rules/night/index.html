        <h2 id="TheBlackMiasma">The Black Miasma</h2>
        <p>
        When the duskshards set for the night, a darkness pervades thicker than a Dusker would ever know. They call it the Miasma.
        </p>
        <p>
        It feels like its a freezing wind blowing right through you- as if the darkness was a rushing river, your body a stone at the bottom, and your soul a weak, clinging algae. It snuffs out fire and dulls coals. You feel sharpness all across your skin, like a million needles trying to break through. It loves the smell of blood too- it will seek out any open wounds and tear them further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it will lie to you. The darkness tells you there are enemies and onlookers just outside your sight. It will tell you they have to die. And in this cold, dark night, wouldn't a flash of pain- a pouring of blood- prove a comforting warmth?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the force that creates the abominations. It twists the mind towards death and violence, and twist the body to accomplish those ends. The only way to fight it is the one light it cannot snuff- an electroplasmic lamp.
        </p>
        <p>
        Don't go out at night.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="YourHoldout">Your Holdout</h2>
        <p>
          Your Holdout is divided into zones. You can move to an adjacent zone on your turn, and generally you must be in the same zone as anything you interact with.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ZoneFeatures">Zone Features</h3>
        <p>
          The following are descriptors a zone may have:
        </p>
        <h4 id="Burning">Burning</h4>
        <p>At end of round, each PC in a burning zone must succeed a Finesse roll or suffer Burned (Level-1 Harm). Each NPC suffers Burned (Level-1 Harm).</p>
        <h4 id="Cluttered">Cluttered</h4>
        <p>All Finesse rolls made in cluttered zones are made with -1d.</p>
        <h4 id="Cramped">Cramped</h4>
        <p>All attack rolls and Finesse rolls made in cramped zones are made with -1d.</p>
        <h4 id="Dark">Dark</h4>
        <p>All Grit, Finesse, and Sense rolls made in a dark zone are made with -3d.</p>
        <h4 id="Miasma">Miasma</h4>
        <p>All rolls made in a miasma zone have -1 effect. At end of round, each PC in a miasma zone must succeed a Grit roll or suffer Harrowed (Level-1 Harm).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="TheDeathlandAbominations">The Deathland Abominations</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="PreparationPhase">Preparation Phase</h2>
        <p>
          While the sky is yet orange, once all PCs have returned to the Holdout, it is time to prepare.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Fuel">Fuel</h3>
        <p>
          In order to provide safety, the generator must be fueled. The generator consumes fuel depending on how much power is being used- in general, 1 Supply can power one lamp for 4 hours. Power can be specifically rerouted to and from lamps to conserve power or to alter the battlefield; this can be done during any phase.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Traps">Traps</h3>
        <p>Spend 1 supply to coat a zone with fuel. Light as an action, roll each turn it burns.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="HiddenPhase">Hidden Phase</h2>
        <p>This phase ends when a PC is seen. Every round in the Hidden Phase is equivalent to 6 rounds in the Holdout Phase. Whenever moving from one zone to another, roll Finesse.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="HoldoutPhase">Holdout Phase</h2>
        <h3 id="RoundStructure">Round Structure</h3>
        <p>
          Each round progresses in order:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Top of Round.</b> Each PC chooses "Fast Turn" or "Slow Turn".</li>
          <li><b>PC Fast Turns.</b> Each PC who chose "Fast Turn" may take one action. PCs take turns simultaneously, but once a player has begun an
          action, they must resolve that action before any player may take another action.</li>
          <li><b>Enemy Fast Turns.</b> Each enemy taking a fast turn acts.</li>
          <li><b>PC Slow Turns.</b> Each PC who did not act during fast turns
            may take two actions. Again, PCs take turns simultaneously, but once a PC
            has begun an
          action, they must resolve that action before any PC may take another action.</li>
          <li><b>Enemy Slow Turns.</b> Each enemy which did not take a fast turn acts.</li>
          <li><b>End of Round.</b></li>
        </ol>
