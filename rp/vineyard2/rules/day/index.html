  			<p>
          This game uses six-sided dice. When there is uncertainty, roll several and look at the highest number rolled.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On a <b>1-3</b>, you <b>Fumble</b>. Things go poorly.</li>
          <li>A <b>4 or 5</b> is a <b>Mixed Success</b>. You achieve your goal but with a consequence.</li>
          <li>A <b>6</b> is a <b>True Success</b>. You achieve your goal.</li>
          <li>If more than one <b>6</b> are rolled, it's a <b>Critical Success</b>. You succeed beyond all expectation.
            Whenever this happens, the roller gains 1 <a href="#momentum">Momentum</a> for each 6 rolled beyond the first.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>If you would roll zero or fewer dice, instead roll two dice and look at the lowest.</i></p>
        <p>
          To create a dice pool for a roll, you pick a relevant <a href="#Attributes">attribute</a>, and roll dice equal to its number.
          Effects which say "take +d" add one die to relevant rolls,
          and effects which say "take -d" subtract one.

  			<h2 id="StructureOfTheGame">Structure of the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The game takes place over a series of days, each with four parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day begins at <b>Dawn</b>. The characters talk to each other, discuss plans, and prepare for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the group is ready, they enter <b>Daylight</b>. Each PC decides what tasks they will accomplish for the day
          and goes about them. They make rolls, overcome obstacles, and hopefully succeed. See <a href="/daylight/">Daylight</a> for details.
          When all tasks are finished, the game moves towards <b>Preparation</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Preparation, PCs must return to their chosen Holdout. They then power their generator, set any traps, and decide their
          strategy. See <a href="/preparation/">Preparation</a> for details. When preparations are complete, and the sun has set, the game enters <b>Holdout</b>, during which they can only wait and survive until <b>Dawn</b> graces them again. See <a href="/holdout/">Holdout</a> for details.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
  			<h2 id="Attributes">Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Each player character has five attributes, each a number between 0 and 5, which tells you how many dice to roll when
          using that attribute.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Grit (GR)</b> is a PC's physical prowess. It measures strength, endurance, and resistance to physical injury. Use Grit when wielding a heavy tool, running long distances, putting on an intimidating display, or fighting off a disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Finesse (FN)</b> is a PC's physical fidelity. It measures flexibility, reaction speed, and ability to dodge. Use Finesse when using a precise tool, moving stealthily, telling a convincing lie, or avoiding danger quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Acuity (AC)</b> is a PC's mental clarity. It measures logical reasoning, planning, and persuasiveness. Use Acuity when researching, working with technical devices, or giving a rousing speech.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sense (SN)</b> is a PC's perception. It measures one's ability to percieve and quickly interpret the sights, sounds, and fine details of their environment. Use Sense when scanning the horizon, listening for footsteps, or reading body language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Attunement (AT)</b> is a PC's connection with the supernatural and the arcane. It measures one's ability to listen to, control, and resist the deadly allure of the ghost field permeating the air. Use Attunement when performing an arcane ritual, opening your mind to the restless souls, or channelling electroplasmic energy trough your body. <i>This is always dangerous and will have consequences.</i>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
  			<h2 id="EffectLevel">Effect Level</h2>
        <p>
          While Attributes govern how likely a given roll is to succeed, Effect Level determines the magnitude of the result. It is largely determined by the equipment and tools used, as well as the environment and circumstances. Before you perform roll, the GM will tell you your predicted effect level.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Level</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
          <tr><td class="center">0</td><td><b>Zero.</b> Your achievements are negligable. A fist against stone.</td></tr>
          <tr><td class="center">1</td><td><b>Limited.</b> You achieve a partial or weak effect. A stone hammer against stone.</td></tr>
          <tr><td class="center">2</td><td><b>Standard.</b> You achieve what might be expected on an even playing field. A pickaxe against stone.</td></tr>
          <tr><td class="center">3</td><td><b>Great.</b> You achieve above usual. Spark-craft against stone.</td></tr>
          <tr><td class="center">4+</td><td><b>Extreme.</b> You achieve beyond great.</td></tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Assessing Effect Level</h3>
        <p>Start with your gut feeling, ask <i>how much could a person of average skill accomplish in this environment?</i>
        If one side has an advantage in potency, quality, or scale, that side will generally have greater effect. Are resources and time limited or plentiful? Are tools easy to use and effective? Is there a particular weakness to be taken advantage of? Oftentimes, a clever strategy may require fewer dice, but increase effect.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="Harm">Harm</h2>
        <p>Harm is a consequence which represents a long-lasting injury- physical, mental, or supernatural. When a PC suffers harm, they record the specific injury on their character sheet equal to the level of harm suffered.</p>
        <p>While a row of harm is filled, the PC suffers the penalty listed for that row. While a PC has two Level-1 Harm, they have -1 effect to all rolls. While a PC has two Level-2 harm, they have -d to all rolls. While a PC has any Level-3 harm, they can't do anything without help from an ally or risking serious consequences.</p>
        <p>If a PC would record harm, but the row is already filled, the harm increases to the next available level. If any recorded harm would exceed Level-3, that PC is <b>downed</b>, cannot perform any actions, and suffers a <b>severe permanent consequence</b>.</p>
        <ul><li>To <b>heal a harm</b>, erase the harm from your sheet.</li>
        <li>To <b>reduce a harm</b>, move it to the previous level <i>only if</i> a space is available.</li>
        <li>To <b>aggravate a harm</b>, move it to the next available level.</li></ul>
        <h3>Armor</h3>
        <p>If a PC has a type of armor that can resist a harm they would suffer, they can mark an armor box to negate the harm. Once an armor box is marked, it cannot be used again until it's restored at Dawn.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="Momentum">Momentum</h2>
        <p><b>Momentum</b> represents a PCs extra energy built up throughout the day, which can be spent to exert themselves and achieve above-normal feats. Whenever a PC rolls a <b>Critical Success</b>, they gain 1 Momentum for each 6 rolled after the first. See <a href="holdout/#MometumMoves">Momentum Moves</a> to see how Momentum can be spent.</p>
        <p>Each PC has a Momentum Cap, which limits how much Momentum can be retained from day to day. When a PC <a href="day/#Rest">rests</a>, they lose all excess Momentum above their Momentum Cap.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="Supply">Supply</h2>
        <p>Supply is an abstract measure of food, fuel, and ammunition; which material it is is determined upon use. One unit of supply can feed one person for a day, power an electroplasmic lamp for four hours, or fully load one gun. It can also represent other common resources such as money, common medical supplies like bandages and opium, construction tools, and animal feed. Typical rations would consist of rice, fish, goat-cheese, and wine if you're lucky, or eel and mushrooms if you're not.</p>
