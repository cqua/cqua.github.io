            "A roleplaying game is a conversation between the GM and the players, punctuated by dice rolls to inject uncertainty and surprising turns.

            "The GM presents the fictional situation in which the player characters find themselves. The players determine the actions of their characters in response to the situation. The GM and the players together judge how the game systems are engaged. The outcomes of the mechanics then change the situation, leading into a new phase of the conversation—new situations, new actions, new judgments, new rolls—creating an ongoing fiction and building “the story” of the game, organically, from a series of discrete moments.

          <p>
            "<b>No one is in charge of the story.</b> The story is what happens as a result of the situation presented by the GM, the actions the characters take, the outcomes of the mechanics, and the consequences that result. The story emerges from the unpredictable collision of all of these elements. You <b>play to find out</b> what the story will be."

  			<h2>Rolling Dice</h2>
  			<p>
          This game uses six-sided dice. When there is uncertainty, roll several and look at the highest number rolled.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On a <b>1-3</b>, you <b>Fumble</b>. Things go poorly.</li>
          <li>A <b>4 or 5</b> is a <b>Mixed Success</b>. You achieve your goal but with a consequence.</li>
          <li>A <b>6</b> is a <b>True Success</b>. You achieve your goal.</li>
          <li>If more than one <b>6</b> are rolled, it's a <b>Critical Success</b>. You succeed beyond all expectation.
            Whenever this happens, the roller gains 1 <a href="#momentum">Momentum</a> for each 6 rolled beyond the first.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>If you would roll zero or fewer dice, instead roll two dice and look at the lowest.</i></p>
        <p>
          To create a dice pool for a roll, you pick a relevant <a href="#attribute">attribute</a>, and roll dice equal to its number.
          Effects which say "take +d" add one die to relevant rolls,
          and effects which say "take -d" subtract one.

  			<h2>Structure of the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The game takes place over a series of days, each with four parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day begins at <b>Dawn</b>. The characters talk to each other, discuss plans, and prepare for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the group is ready, they enter <b>Daylight</b>. Each PC decides what tasks they will accomplish for the day
          and goes about them. They make rolls, overcome obstacles, and hopefully succeed. See <a href="/daylight/">Daylight</a> for details.
          When all tasks are finished, the game moves towards <b>Preparation</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Preparation, PCs must return to their chosen Holdout. They then power their generator, set any traps, and decide their
          strategy. See <a href="/preparation/">Preparation</a> for details. When preparations are complete, and the sun has set, the game enters <b>Holdout</b>, during which they can only wait and survive until <b>Dawn</b> graces them again. See <a href="/holdout/">Holdout</a> for details.
        </p>

  			<h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Each player character has five attributes, each a number between 0 and 5, which tells you how many dice to roll when
          using that attribute.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Grit (GR)</b> is a PC's physical prowess. It measures strength, endurance, and resistance to physical injury. Use Grit when wielding a heavy tool, running long distances, putting on an intimidating display, or fighting off a disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Finesse (FN)</b> is a PC's physical fidelity. It measures flexibility, reaction speed, and ability to dodge. Use Finesse when using a precise tool, moving stealthily, telling a convincing lie, or avoiding danger quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Acuity (AC)</b> is a PC's mental clarity. It measures logical reasoning, planning, and persuasiveness. Use Acuity when researching, working with technical devices, or giving a rousing speech.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sense (SN)</b> is a PC's perception. It measures one's ability to percieve and quickly interpret the sights, sounds, and fine details of their environment. Use Sense when scanning the horizon, listening for footsteps, or reading body language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Attunement (AT)</b> is a PC's connection with the supernatural and the arcane. It measures one's ability to listen to, control, and resist the deadly allure of the ghost field permeating the air. Use Attunement when performing an arcane ritual, opening your mind to the restless souls, or channelling electroplasmic energy trough your body. <i>This is always dangerous and will have consequences.</i>
          </li>
        </ul>
