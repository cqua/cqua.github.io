		<h1>Beasthood</h1>
		<p>
			Characters risk beasthood when they begin to be lost in nature. The woods have a way of claiming souls when one encounters the strange, the unsettling, or the unknowable. Being affected by sylvan magic, encountering faeries and dryads, and witnessing the deepest wells of mana slowly transform mortals into something else.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whenever you gain beasthood, you become frightened for a number of rounds equal to your new beasthood total. If you are already frightened, you instead become stunned for the duration. When your beasthood total equals your Maximum Beasthood, you are overcome. Roll 2d6 and add them on the beasthood table to determine the outcome. This removes the frightened affliction, and afterward your beasthood is decreased by 1d6+WIL (minimum 1).
		</p>
		<p>
			Once per day, you can remove all beasthood by taking a Wild Mark from the Mark of the Forest table. These are permanent changes that represent the effects of ancient mana on your body. You may roll on the table or choose a mark that fits your situation. When you do this, your Maximum Beasthood increases permanently by your Will (minimum 1).
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also spend 24 hours in a human or elven city to remove 1 beasthood.
		</p>
