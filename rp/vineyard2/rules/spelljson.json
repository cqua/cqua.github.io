If you name a place that does not exist, the spell fails and the casting is wasted. On a success, the targets teleport to the destination. On a failure, each target teleports separately to a location within 1d20 miles of the destination, as chosen by the GM. If the total of the roll is 0 or less, each target also takes 10d6 damage and gains 1 Insanity from the spell going horribly wrong. If the destination space is not large enough to accommodate a target, the target takes 5d6 damage, gains 1 Insanity, and returns to the space it left. A creature incapacitated by this damage is slain on arrival, reduced to a heap of blood, bone, and tissue. If the destination space is not open- such as inside a wall- the target fuses with the material filling the destination and dies instantly.</p>",
