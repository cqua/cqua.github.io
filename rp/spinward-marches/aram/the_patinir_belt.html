			  The Patinir System lies on the very edge of the Aramis subsector, dominated by a large gas giant, with a number of
			  small rocky planets and satellites. The primary source of mineral wealth in the system however, is the broad asteroid belt 
			  circling the central star. In orbit ahead of and trailing, the gas giant are accumulations of asteroids at the 
			  
			  <span class="dropdown">Trojan points.<span class="dropdown-content"><img id="trojan" src="../css/trojan-points.jpg" alt="Trojan">
			  <br>A type of co-orbital object. A planet orbits around a massive star, while
			  a much smaller mass located at one of the Trojan points is subject to a combined gravitational force. 
			  Hence the object can orbit around the star with the same orbital period as the planet, 
			  and the arrangement can remain stable over time.</span></span>
			  
			  These Trojan points are each the site of a self-contained space colony of about 480,000 persons population. 
			  Effectively identical, the space colonies each operate a refinery smelter, which processes are taken from the 
			  larger asteroid belt which orbits starward of the gas giant.	</p>
	<p>The government of Patinir is a select board of directors controlled by the colony owners (descendants and heirs of the original financiers).
	Local law level is low in the colonies and non-existent outside the Trojan points. The local technological level reflects a deliberate colony design feature, which makes facilities and equipment maintainable even in the event of a technological decline.
		</p><p>The asteroid belt starward contains slightly less than half of the systemâ€™s population of 1.8 million as miners, prospectors, concessionaires and a small lawless element. This small population means that even after a century of prospecting, the belt remains virtually untapped and a ripe source of undiscovered minerals.
