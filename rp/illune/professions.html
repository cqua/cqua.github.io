			<h1>PROFESSIONS</h1>
			<p>
				Professions describe what your character knows how to do and how your character fits into the setting. They act as cues to help you decide how your character acts, what your character can do, and what things your character knows. The Game Master will sometimes look to your professions to judge whether an activity you describe results in a success or failure. A profession could grant a success or it might grant 1 or more boons to your roll if the outcome isn’t clear.
