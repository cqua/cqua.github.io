		<h1>INSANITY</h1>
		<p>
			Characters risk madness when they encounter the strange, the unsettling, or the awful. Being affected by dark magic, encountering horrifying demons released from the Void, and witnessing acts of sudden, brutal violence can stress or even shatter the mind. Insanity measures this stress.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whenever you gain Insanity, you become frightened for a number of rounds equal to your new Insanity total. If you are already frightened, you instead become stunned for the duration. When your Insanity total reaches your Will score, you instead go mad. Roll a d20 to determine the outcome. Madness removes the frightened affliction, and afterward your Insanity is decreased by 1d6+WIL (minimum 1).
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also rest for 24 hours to remove 1 insanity.
		</p>
		<h3>The Frightening & the Horrifying</h3>
		<p>
			Some creatures have a disturbing appearance, an otherworldly nature, or an uncanny effect on the world around them. A creature that does not have the frightening or horrifying trait must make a Will challenge roll when it first sees one or more creatures with these traits. It makes the roll with 1 bane if it can see four or more of these creatures at once.
		</p>
		<p>
			On a failure, the creature becomes frightened for a number of rounds equal to 1d3 + its Insanity total or gains 1 Insanity if it is already frightened. If the triggering creature is horrifying, the target creature gains an additional 1d3 insanity. Once a creature makes this roll, whether it succeeds or fails, it cannot again be affected by this trait of the creature or creatures it saw until after it completes a rest.
		</p>
		<p>
			Regardless of the outcome of the challenge roll, creatures that lack the frightening or horrifying trait make attack rolls against horrifying creatures with 1 bane.
		</p>
		<h2>QUIRKS</h2>
		<p>
			Once per day, you can clear all insanity and take a Quirk. A quirk is a compulsive behavior, a phobia, or another condition that permanently affects your character. See below for a list of quirks.
		</p>
		<table class="table table-dark">
			<tr>
				<th>d20</th><th>Quirk</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td><td><b>Strangers Everywhere.</b> You no longer recognize faces; everyone seems to be the same, differentiated only by their voices and clothing.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td><td><b>Sticky Fingers.</b> You have a compulsion to steal. Whenever you see an item you can hold in one hand that’s neither worn nor carried by another creature, you must take it unless you get a success on a Will challenge roll.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td><td><b>Blank Slate.</b> You lose your personality traits and adopt those of the people around you. You become dazed for as long as you cannot see or hear a creature other than you.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td><td><b>Liar, Liar.</b> You can’t tell the truth. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td><td><b>Obsession.</b> You become obsessed by whatever task you undertake. Once you start something, you cannot stop until you finish, and if you are prevented from doing so, you become impaired until you resume that activity. A task might be attacking a particular enemy until it’s destroyed, attempting to climb a wall, reading a book, and so on.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td><td><b>Ennui.</b> You become disinterested in the world around you, finding it difficult to undertake any activity. You cannot take fast turns.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>7</td><td><b>Glooms.</b> You become depressed, your mind descending into darkness. You make attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 bane. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>8</td><td><b>Staggering Confidence.</b> You become certain of your capabilities, so much so that you make all attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon. However, if you get a failure, you become dazed for 1 minute.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>9</td><td><b>Craven.</b> Fear consumes you. You make challenge rolls to avoid or stop becoming frightened with 3 banes, and you double the duration of the frightened affliction when you develop it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>10</td><td><b>Strange Beliefs.</b> You believe in untrue things, causing you to behave erratically. You make attack rolls in social situations with 1 bane.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>11</td><td><b>Boundless Energy.</b> You are confident, quick to act, and reckless. You can only take fast turns.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>12</td><td><b>Paranoia.</b> Everyone is out to get you. You make attack rolls in social situations with 1 bane. As well, you derive no benefit from characters using their action to help you, and you cannot be a willing target of any spell effect cast by a member in your group.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>13</td><td><b>Hope and Despair.</b> You swing from hope to despair and back again with little warning. Each time you complete a rest, roll a d6. If you rolled an even number, you start with hope, making attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon. If you rolled an odd number, you start with despair, making attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 bane. Whenever you get a failure on an attack roll or challenge roll, you switch from hope to despair or despair to hope.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>14</td><td><b>Untrustworthy Senses.</b> You see and hear things that aren’t there. You make Perception challenge rolls with 3 banes.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>15</td><td><b>Pain is Pleasure.</b> You experience a thrill of pleasure when you inflict harm or receive it. Once per round, when you deal damage or take damage, you make your next attack roll or challenge roll before the end of the next round with 1 boon.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>16</td><td><b>Murderous Impulses.</b> You are a bloodthirsty killer. Your attacks with weapons deal 1d3 extra damage, but you have to make free attacks when any creature, even members of your group, trigger them.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>17</td><td><b>Memory Loss.</b> You lose all of your professions. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>18</td><td><b>Death Wish.</b> You want to die. Whenever you take damage, you take 1d6 extra damage. As well, when you make Fate Rolls when you’re incapacitated, you must roll twice and use the lowest result.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>19</td><td><b>Shattered Intellect.</b> You become defenseless, in a catatonic state from which you might never awaken.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>20</td><td><b>Fractured Personality.</b> Your personality splinters into 1d3 + 1 pieces. One of those pieces is your true self. The others are new personalities invented by your mind. For each personality, randomly determine its gender and then use your ancestry tables to create a new character, ignoring any table that would alter the character’s appearance. Then, randomly determine the personality’s profession. Henceforth, whenever you gain Insanity, your personality changes to a different one, either determined randomly or chosen by the GM. You remain in that personality until you gain Insanity again.
