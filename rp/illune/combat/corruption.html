		<h1>CORRUPTION</h1>
		<p>
			Evil leaves a stain on the mortal soul that can be removed only by the devils haunting Hell’s depths. These warped faerie feed on the darkness that burdens immortal essence. Most people believe evil actions have spiritual consequences, though many don’t care.
		</p>
		<p>
			Player characters have Corruption scores to reflect the evil they commit. The more corrupt a character becomes, the greater the taint of evil on his or her soul, until it is consigned to Hell.
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples of acts that would increase Corruption include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Murder.</li>
			<li>Harming an innocent by spreading a disease, poisoning a well, or being reckless with magic.</li>
			<li>Stealing for personal gain.</li>
			<li>Learning spells from dark traditions such as Forbidden or Necromancy.</li>
			<li>Using certain relics.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>ATONEMENT</h3>
		<p>
			Corruption, once gained, is hard to lose without the tender attentions of the devils that feed on it. Powerful magic can cleanse a soul that is only lightly stained, though such magic is rare and hard to come by. Repentant mortals can erase some or even all of their Corruption by committing their lives to good works, making amends for past misdeeds, and conducting themselves selflessly and with charity, virtue, and compassion for others.
		</p>
