		<h1>ENGINEER</h1>
		<p>
			A career spent creating wondrous devices earns engineers their renown. The culmination of an engineer’s training is the creation of an eidolon, a mechanical servant of enormous size that obeys its maker’s commands. Engineers go to great lengths to maintain their creations and constantly make small improvements to increase their servants’ functionality.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 7 ENGINEER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Attributes</b> Increase three by 1<br/>

		<p>
			<b>Eidolon</b> You create a construct that has a humanoid shape but can otherwise have any appearance you choose. The eidolon is 12 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds. You can have only one eidolon at a time. If your eidolon is destroyed, you can build a new one to replace it. Doing so requires you to work at least eight hours using parts you create or harvested from your old eidolon. At the end of this time, you have a new eidolon. The eidolon is not alive. It is never affected by deprivation or exposure, and it ignores any effect that would age it. When incapacitated, the eidolon ceases to be a creature and becomes an object The eidolon is under your control. You decide what it does on each of its turns.

		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +3<br/>

		<p>
			<b>Cockpit</b> You install a cockpit in your eidolon. The cockpit is a compartment with a Size 1 capacity and fitted with controls and a comfortable seat. Any creature of the appropriate Size can move into the cockpit if it isn’t occupied. Once inside, the creature can control it from within. While inside, you treat the construct’s Defense and Health scores as your own, move at its Speed, and can use its attack options and actions in place of your own. The cockpit has breathable air for 4 hours. A creature inside can use an action to open the hatch, ventilate the interior, and close it to gain another 4 hours of air. A creature can leave the hatch open for as long it wishes, though the eidolon does not function while the hatch is open.

		<h1>EXECUTIONER</h1>
		<p>
			Executioners elevate killing to an art form. An extensive study of anatomy reveals how best to make their attacks so that every strike is potentially devastating, strong enough to lay low the mightiest foes. Although many executioners start their training as assassins, others take this path after being headsmen, torturers, or devotees of bizarre death cults. Executioners, regardless of their backgrounds, prefer dark clothing and black hoods to conceal their features.

And should their ruse be exposed, infiltrators know how to slip away from their pursuers unscathed.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h1>INQUISITOR</h1>
		<p>
			Nearly all inquisitors serve the cult of the New God, working to expose corruption in the religion’s ranks and to flush out the demon-sworn, the damned, and the wicked. Key to their work is the ability to ferret out the truth. Not only do they know when people lie to them, but they also know numerous torture techniques to get their victims to reveal all their secrets.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 7 INQUISITOR</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Attributes</b> Increase three by 1<br/>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +3<br/>

		<p>
			<b>Dreadful Threat</b> You can use an action to deliver a terrible threat to one target creature that is subject to your Scrutiny talent and is within short range. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, the target becomes frightened while it can see you. The effect ends when the target deals damage to you or after it completes a rest.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Master Torturer</b> You can use an action to start torturing one defenseless or physically restrained creature within your reach. If you concentrate for at least 1 hour, during which time you use torturer’s tools on the target, you make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, you can ask the target 1d6 questions (the GM rolls and keeps the number a secret), and the target must answer you truthfully and to the best of its knowledge. If it doesn’t know the answer, it makes up something that you might want to hear, though it’s up to you to interpret what it says as truth or not. On a failure, the target becomes immune to this talent until it completes a rest.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Scrutiny</b> You can use an action to study one creature you can see within medium range. Make a Perception attack roll against the target’s Intellect. On a success, the target is subject to your scrutiny until it completes a rest, until you can no longer see it, or until you use this talent again. On a failure, the target becomes immune to your use of this talent until it completes a rest.
		</p>
		<p>
			While a creature is subject to your scrutiny, you know whenever it deliberately speaks a lie, and when you attack it, you make the attack roll with 1 boon.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 10 INQUISITOR</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +3<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Inquisitor's Judgement</b> Your weapon attacks against creatures subject to your scrutiny deal 1d6 extra damage.
