		<h1>POISONER</h1>
		<p>
			There are few trades as disreputable as the manufacture of poisons, so poisoners rarely display honor or virtue in their dealings with others. Commanding extensive knowledge of all things toxic, they can produce the deadliest poisons to deal with almost any kind of creature. Poisoners always have some sort of toxin on hand to protect them when justice comes for them.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h1>REAVER</h1>
		<p>
			Rejecting the trappings of civilization, reavers come screaming out of the wilderness, armed with a fearlessness that lets them face any foe, no matter how large or terrible. Those following the reaver path embrace the wild side, becoming savage, deadly, and eager to greet foes with violence. A reaver might have been a bold warrior, cunning thief, or devout priest, but in all cases, a reaver follows a wilder, bloodier, and far more violent path.
		</p>
