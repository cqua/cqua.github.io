		<h1>GODS OF IKSEIRA</h1>
		<h2>BRUTUS, the Horned King</h2>
		<p>
			<b>God of nature, beasts, and chaos.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			He takes the most after the Gods’ mother Eryth. He is worshiped by druids and hermits, as well as beastmen hoping for redemption. Unlike other Gods, Brutus has no court of his own. Instead, he presides over and protects the forests and great beasts. Some say that the mortal plane is his court, but if this were true, he has ceded most of his land to the mortals. His symbol is thee interlocking horns.
		</p>
		<h2>ETURNAM, the Reaper</h2>
		<p>
			<b>God of change, luck, and the dead.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			They are responsible for the changing of states: summer to winter, fortune to misfortune, life to death. Souls pass between realms only with Eturnam permission. Every Spring, Eturnam faces Suthr in brutal combat, returning Winter to its realm, and every Autumn, Eturnam gently escourts Hestia back to the Summercourt. Eturnam is the patron of necromancers and dedicated warlords, but also of gamblers and sailors. Their symbol is the scythe.
		</p>
		<h2>HESTIA, the Summerqueen</h2>
		<p>
			<b>God of harvest, life, and the celestial.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Hestia is the patron of healers and lawmakers, romantics and poets. She is responsible for the Summer, and her blessings are more potent under a Summer sky. As such, her powers were especially revered during ancient times in the deserts by Sum-Of-All. Nowadays, she has no power there. Her symbol is the sun.
		</p>
		<h2>ILLUNE, the Lunar Maiden</h2>
		<p>
			<b>God of the moon, travel, and amnesty.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			She is the patron of elves, but also travelers. More than anyone else, her followers are known for going to the needy and providing. Her realm, sometimes called the Lunarcourt, is open for travellers to use to get around the archipelago quickly. Its halls are infinite however, and one can easily be lost forever. Her symbol is the moon.
		</p>
		<h2>THE SEER, the One-Eyed Owl</h2>
		<p>
			<b>God of sorcery, and knowledge, and secrecy.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Seer is said to have been the one to grant humans language. She is the patron of wise men, as well as thieves looking to confide in the oldest keeper of secrets. It is said he dwells in an ancient, infinite library which some call the Shadowcourt. Stories tell of lost souls wandering the passages trying to make sense of the infinite knowledge stored within. Her symbol is a pair of eyes, one blinded.
		</p>
		<h2>SUTHR, the Winterking</h2>
		<p>
			<b>God of frost, song, and battle.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Suthr is the patron of warriors and bards. He is responsible for the Winter, and his blessings are more potent under a Winter sky. As such, he is especially venerated in Torig to the north. during the Summer, he dwells in the Wintercourt, a prison of hate and ice. His symbol is a sprig of spruce.
		</p>
		<h2>AMAAT, the New God</h2>
		<p>
			A cult has appeared in the last 200 years claiming that sorcery is a contract with the demons, and anyone who uses magic stains their soul. In its place, Amaat grants their followers miracles to heal and teach the lost. The most respected among Amaat's worshippers are called Insquisitors, who hunt the demons and their servants. Their symbol is a snake eating its own tail.
		</p>
		<h2>THE DEMON LORDS</h2>
		<p>
			In return for mortals’ eternal service, the gods have kept the demons in Hell where they cannot do much harm. Many of these are still worshiped by dark forces in the world. The four most powerful among these are called Demon Lords. They include <b>Warfather Abaddon</b>, the <b>Deep Shadow of Revel</b>, <b>Baphomet of the Feral Moon</b> (also called Goetherah), and <b>Kha the Boundless Flame</b>.
