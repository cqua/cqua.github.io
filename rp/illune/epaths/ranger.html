		<h1>RANGER</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../content/paths/ranger.png" alt="Ranger">
		<p>
			The first line of defense against the darkness outside the
civilized lands, rangers prowl the wilderness, always on the
move, never staying in one place for too long. Consummate
survivors, rangers know how to get along in the wild. They
know how to find water, what foods to forage, and how to hunt
and trap game. Whether they climb the trackless mountains
or stalk through the deepest forests, rangers are no more in
their element than when they are in the midst of the wilds.
		</p>
		<p>
The ranger’s life is one of isolation. Many feel called to
set out into the most dangerous lands, where they wage war
against the monstrosities that pose the direst threat to ordinary
people. Others have cut ties to their homeland, preferring
to keep their own company to the crowds and stench of the
cities. Most rangers see it as their duty to protect the natural
places and those who struggle to make a life on the frontier,
though some feel no obligation to the world, and might
even join forces with other wild things to curb civilization’s
encroachment upon the untamed lands.
		</p>
		<p>
Rangers come from all backgrounds. Warriors might
become rangers after fighting monsters in the wild or blazing
trails into unknown lands, while rogues might develop ranger
talents after being outlaws or bandits forced out of urban
environments. Many priests of the Old Faith and magicians
focused on Nature and Primal magic become rangers to
champion their gods or to deepen their connection to the
natural world.
