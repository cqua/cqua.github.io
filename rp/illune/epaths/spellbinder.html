			To even the odds against the iron-wielding trolls, the faeries
devised the art of spellbinding, a technique that allowed
them to channel magical energy into their weapons. Armed
with bronze swords limned in eldritch flames and bows
capable of loosing empowered arrows, the spellbinders
could cut through their enemies’ defenses, driving back or
outright destroying their monstrous creations. Ultimately,
spellbinding proved to be one of the most significant
weapons used in the defeat of the hated trolls and their
unspeakable armies. For centuries thereafter, the faeries
guarded the secrets of spellbinding from other peoples to
ensure their magic could not be used against them. It is
not known whether it was revealed by unscrupulous fey or
simply discovered by non-fey on their own, but eventually
the spellbinding tradition became known by almost all
peoples on Rûl.
		</p>
		<p>
The heart of spellbinding lies in a single spell, one which
allows casters to imbue their weapons with magical energy
that binds the weapon to them and enhances the weapon’s
deadliness. Spellbinders can call their empowered weapon
to hand with a command, reassemble the weapon from
fragments, and use the weapon as their implement to
cast other spells. In time, spellbinders learn to channel
even more magic through the weapon, making them truly
formidable combatants.
