		<h1>DRUID</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../content/paths/druid.png" alt="Druid">
		<p>
			The druids belong to the Old Faith, one of the oldest
religions in the Empire. With origins going back all the way
to the first people to inhabit the lands, it is a religion whose
roots are secret, created to honor dark, often violent gods,
and steeped in strange practices. Druids count themselves
friend to any who live in the wild or along its borders,
but they guard the secrets of their religion, revealing its
mysteries only to those who have undergone the rites that
open the way to their enigmatic society.
		</p>
		<p>
Many druids use Nature and Primal magic, though
some learn magic from elemental traditions or traditions
associated with the faerie, such as Enchantment and
Illusion. Although druids venerate all the old gods, a few
align themselves with one or two in particular. The Horned
King, the Maiden in the Moon, and the Queen of Summer
are all common patrons.
		</p>
		<p>
Above all, druids see themselves as guardians of
the natural world. They protect the uncut woods, the
unspoiled wilds, and the places far beyond civilizationâ€™s
grasp. They work alongside settlers and pioneers to help
them withstand the rigors of the frontier while instilling in
them respect for the land and its resources. Druids protect
specific sites, marking them with standing stones, or travel
the world, lending a hand to those in need.
