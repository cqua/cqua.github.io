		<h1>FIGHTER</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../content/paths/fighter.png" alt="Fighter">
		<p>
			Some of the greatest warriors to ever walk the world were
fighters. Unmatched when it comes to combat training,
fighters display incredible excellence at arms, and the
tenacity to withstand the worst battle conditions. From
hard-bitten mercenaries to keen-eyed archers, they include
any who devote time and training to the mastery of arms
and armor.
		</p>
		<p>
Fighters demonstrate their combat prowess with any
weapon they wield, but most favor certain styles over
others. Some fighters prefer to hang back and loose missile
after missile into their foes, while others roar and leap into
the thick of battle, methodically swinging axe and sword
upon their foes, as ribbons of blood and severed limbs fling
about into the air.
