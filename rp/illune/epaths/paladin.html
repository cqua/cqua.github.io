		<h1>PALADIN</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../content/paths/paladin.png" alt="Paladin">
		<p>
			Holy warriors possessed of great courage and determination,
paladins take the fight to darkness, waging war eternal
against the forces of wickedness and unrest threatening to
upset the foundation on which civilization stands. Most
paladins hear their gods calling them to take up arms and
join the struggle against demons and foul monsters. Others
take up the paladin’s life out of a sense of obligation, concern
over troubling events, or from a need for vengeance against
those who have brought ruin to the world.
		</p>
		<p>
Any religion or faith can produce paladins. Paladins
affiliated with the cult of the New God might be temple
guardians, valiant crusaders, or even inquisitors. Those with
ties to the Old Faith rely on Nature and Primal magic to give
them strength against their foes. And there are even some
paladins with ties to witchcraft who take on the role as a
coven’s protector or a witch’s guardian.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 3 PALADIN</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Attributes</b> Increase two by 1<br/>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +4, Power +1<br/>
			<b>Languages and Professions</b> Add two professions.<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You discover a tradition associated with your Oath (as described in the Priest novice path), or learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Divine Cause</b> When you would make a challenge roll to resist an attack, you can expend the casting of a spell. You make the roll with a number of boons equal to the rank of the spell whose casting you expended (minimum 1 boon).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Divine Smite</b> When you get a success on an attack with a weapon, you can expend the casting of a spell. The attack deals 1d6 extra damage per rank of the spell whose casting you expended (minimum 1d6 extra damage). If the target of your attack was a demon, devil, faerie, spirit, or undead, you increase the extra damage by 1d6.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Faith Healing</b> You can use an action to touch one living creature you can reach that has 0 Corruption and expend a casting of a spell. Choose one of the following effects.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The target heals 1d6 damage per rank of the spell expended (minimum 1d6).</li>
			<li>If you expended a rank 2 or higher spell, you can remove the diseased or poisoned affliction from the target.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>LEVEL 6 PALADIN</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +4<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Divine Vigor</b>  You take no damage from disease or poison and you are immune to the diseased and poisoned afflictions.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Sense Enemies</b> You can use an action, or a triggered action on your turn, to attune your senses to detect creatures around you for 1 minute. Until the effect ends, no creature within short range can be hidden from you and no creature with 1 Corruption or more within medium range can be hidden from you. Such creatures derive no benefits from being obscured from you. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your Power. You regain expended uses when you complete a rest. 
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 9 MASTER PALADIN</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +4, Power +1<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You learn one spell.
		</p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Until this effect ends, you and creatures you choose within the light cannot be frightened and make challenge rolls to resist attacks with 1 boon. Demons, devils, faeries, spirits, and undead in the area of light are impaired for as long as they remain in the area. (You are not impaired by the light if you yourself are a faerie or undead.)
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use this talent a number of times equal to your Power. You regain expended uses when you complete a rest.
