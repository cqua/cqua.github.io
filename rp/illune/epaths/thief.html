		<h1>THIEF</h1>

		<p>
			Thieves live by taking things that don’t belong to them.
They have the skills they need to do so without being
caught in the act. They palm objects, lift items from people
they brush up against, thwart locks, foil traps, and discover
ways into places ordinarily forbidden to them. Although
many thieves steal for selfish reasons or because they feel
the need to do so, others develop the techniques to explore
tombs, scour ruins for lost relics, or hunt down other
thieves and bring them to justice.

			When rope bindings or manacles restrain you, you can use an action to attempt to escape the bonds. You must concentrate for 1 minute. At the end of this time, make an Agility challenge roll. On a success, you escape the bonds. On a failure, you are bound tight and you remain bound until freed.</li>

The object taken must be something you can hold in one hand and be somewhere on the creature’s body but not held in its hands (or in a similar appendage). If you can see the object, you can take that object. If you can’t, because you reach into a pouch or backpack, the GM determines the item taken.</li>
