			Devils use any trick they can to tempt mortals and lure them to their doom. Some offer wealth, others power, and still others carnal pleasures. In this last case, such revelations rarely result in issue, but when they do—and only with humans—the offspring is called a cambion, a dark creation of Hell loosed into the mortal world to spread darkness wherever it goes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Infernal Heritage</b> Most cambion look human, almost identical to their mortal parent, but all bear some sign that sets them apart from others. This mark reveals that their souls belong to Hell. The sign manifests at different times, with some cambion carrying it from birth and others discovering it in adulthood. It can be subtle, such as a string of numbers on the scalp, or obvious, such as horns breaking from the brow. Cambion have the same range of height and weight that humans do, though tend to live past 80 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Slave to Darkness</b> All cambion feel the stirrings of evil in their hearts, impulses to commit vile acts for no reason. Many find the urges too strong to refuse and eventually become heartless monsters, reveling in the horror they create. A few, however, hold their impulses at bay and might channel the darkness to fight against Hell and its interests.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Common Names</b> Cambion use human names.
		</p>
