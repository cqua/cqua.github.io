		<h1>BEASTMEN</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../content/beastmen.png" alt="Beastmen">
		<p>
			According to legend, the beastmen rejected the gods of the Old Faith in a long-past age. For their blasphemies, the gods took from them the gift of the human form, rendering them little better than animals. The curse plunged the beastmen into madness and evil, impelling them to pledge service to the demons of the Void. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Fur and Blood</b> These primitive and brutal beings fuse animalistic characteristics with humanoid forms. Beastmen are usually fur-covered and have the heads of beasts, such as goats, wolves, bears, rats, and bulls. Filth and dried blood cling to them, crusting on seeping wounds. Most common are the wolf-headed Vargr, who stand 6 to 8 feet tall and weight 200 to 600 pounds. The rat-headed Ysoki stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, weighing up to 250 pounds while the bull-headed Minotaur reach heights of 10 feet and weigh up to 750 pounds. They never live past 50 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Without Homeland</b> Beastmen gather in wild places: deep forests, empty plains, and abandoned, ruined cities, where they raise profane altars. The largest gathering remains in the jungles in Zelt. Before the Empire’s collapse, they kept a careful eye on the movements of the “jungle abominations”. After the Demon Lord’s Shadow fell, many beastmen took to roving the lands, homeless, friendless.
