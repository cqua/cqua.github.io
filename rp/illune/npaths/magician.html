		<h1>MAGICIAN</h1>

		<p>
			Magicians strive to reach the heights of magical power. If they follow this journey to its end, choosing paths to complement what they have learned, they join the most powerful users of magic in the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hopeful magicians must first discover a tradition of magic to begin learning spells. Discovery can be accidental, resulting from being affected by a spell, stumbling into an area steeped in magical energy, or finding power within oneself. Discovery can also be taught. Ancient institutions of magic, wizards, clerics, and others reveal traditions to promising students.
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon discovering a tradition, the magician learns the most basic spells from it. All this prepares magicians for the process of learning greater and more powerful spells.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since magicians freely choose their traditions, they display a range of capabilities. Some favor destructive magic, learning spells that let them harness elemental forces of wind, rain, fire, and earth. Others prefer subtler magic, favoring charms to manipulate the minds of others or illusions to deceive and conceal. Magicians can also be healers, removing afflictions and providing courage, or conjurers, loosing monsters to fight on their behalf, or engineers, creating servants and machines from spare parts they pick up along the way.
		</p>
		<p>
			The possibilities magic offers also present many perils. More than one magician has succumbed to dark magicâ€™s temptations, dabbling into the arts of Forbidden, Necromancy, or worse traditions. Such magic almost always corrupts the magician, but those seeking its power rarely care.
