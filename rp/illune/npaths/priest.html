		<h1>PRIEST</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../content/paths/priest.png" alt="Preist">
		<p>
			Priests derive magical power from pledging service to a cause or supernatural being. Service gives priests purpose in the world and devotion gives them the ability to work magic. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Discovering a tradition is a spiritual experience for priests. They encounter a powerful presence during their travels, feel some sacred presence enter them while studying a text, or have a dream in which they are chosen to inherit great power. The initial experience sets these individuals on the priest’s path and gives them the power they need to further their righteous cause. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Oath stands at the center of priests’ identities. It shapes their behavior, gives them purpose, and reveals their traditions. Priests committed to the Gods use different kinds of magic from those who serve the late Emperor.
		</p>
