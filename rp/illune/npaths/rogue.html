		<h1>ROGUE</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../content/paths/rogue.png" alt="Rogue">
		<p>
			Rogues always have a trick up their sleeves. Using a combination of luck and skill, rogues can usually find solutions to their problems. Their talents come from their ingenuity, cunning, training, and, of course, good fortune, all of which makes them adaptable to any situation. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Although many rogues come from criminal backgrounds, not all rogues are criminals. Rogues include anyone who benefits from trickery and can fit into every aspect of society. While some work as pickpockets in crowded marketplaces and bandits preying on caravans, others act as detectives solving crimes, forward observers gathering information for their allies, or spies ferreting out dark plots.
