		<h1>Traditions of Magic</h1>
		<p>
			All spells belong to traditions. Each tradition describes a category of magical effects that share common characteristics. The 42 traditions are sorted into 7 categories, based on the cultures that developed them.
		</p>
		<h3>Dark Magic</h3>
		<p>
			Dark magic is a fearful culture. Its first proponents were the demon's human collaborators. Humans become playthings, their terror giving the caster power. But beware, every second one spends controlling the demons is one more chain binding them to eternal damnation.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Curse</b> The bread & butter of witches, curses drain the target of vim and vigor for long periods of time or until broken.</li>
			<li><b>Death</b> Used by fatebinders to hasten Eternam's final judgement.</li>
			<li><b>Demonology</b> Demonologists summon demons to carry out their will.</li>
			<li><b>Forbidden</b> The most abhorrent magic ever discovered.</li>
			<li><b>Madness</b> Madness spells erode the minds of its target as well as its caster.</li>
			<li><b>Necromancy</b> Defy the will of Eturnam and dredge up the damned.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Elven Magic</h3>
		<p>
			Little is known about the woodwose outside of the Horned King's domain. The few witches and druids who return to society to tell of the magic in the forest never stay long. Elven magic tends to deal more with trickery and illusion than harm. Make no mistake- an elf is a dangerous, deadly monster.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Conjuration</b> Conjurators create creatures and objects from thin air.</li>
			<li><b>Divination</b> Divination spells use magic to reveal secrets, to anticipate the future and see into the past.</li>
			<li><b>Enchantment</b> Enchantment magic twists minds and emotions, making creatures behave in ways they otherwise would not.</li>
			<li><b>Fey</b> Many Fey spells manipulate their targets by twisting emotions and perceptions to lead others into danger. The more powerful spells of the tradition can summon faerie allies, reveal secrets, and imprison powerful enemies.</li>
			<li><b>Illusion</b> A tradition steeped in artifice and subterfuge, Illusion spells fool the senses, causing creatures to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel things that aren’t real.</li>
			<li><b>Shadow</b> Shadow magic offers its users control over darkness, allowing them to shape shadows, create darkness, and banish the light from the world.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>High Church Magic</h3>
		<p>
			Amaat grants his servants many miracles in return for their service. These spells are more often protective than they are offensive.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Celestial</b> Celestial magic is sacred, the pure distillation of magical energy that can chase away the dark and burn those hateful things that live in it.</li>
			<li><b>Life</b> The Life tradition stands in opposition to death. Students of Life magic work to alleviate suffering, heal the injured, and fight disease, poison, and the other afflictions that trouble the living.</li>
			<li><b>Metal</b> This tradition offers spells and knowledge useful for combating mortal enemies, whether they be wicked faeries or foul demons loosed from the Void.</li>
			<li><b>Order</b> Many Order spells serve to rid randomness and chaos from the world, so that certain actions produce expected outcomes, and to chase off any of uncertainty.</li>
			<li><b>Protection</b> One of the most widely practiced forms of magic, the Protection tradition serves the interests of those who need to safeguard places, people, and objects of import.</li>
			<li><b>Theurgy</b> Theurgy spells can bolster and aid others, filling them with the spirit of the divine so they can accomplish their objectives, and smite the enemies of the gods.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Jotunn Magic</h3>
		<p>
			The magic of the Giants has been passed down even in their absence. Magic is not widely used to the north, and these spells are expected to aid those with non-magic skill, rather than supplement that skill.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Alteration</b> Alteration spells work by augmenting a target’s existing capabilities or by bestowing onto it new ones. Such spells can confer the ability to breathe underwater, to climb like a cockroach up any surface, or make incredible leaps.</li>
			<li><b>Battle</b> Battle magic stands apart from other traditions in that it exists solely to enhance the user’s ability to fight and, ultimately, triumph over one’s enemies.</li>
			<li><b>Invocation</b> An ancient and rarely seen tradition, Invocation magic encompasses the art of calling forth the essence of a powerful being and temporarily binding it to the caster’s physical form. As a result of these bindings, the casters usually assume the physical qualities of the beings they call upon, often becoming strange and monstrous in appearance, and sometimes also in mind.</li>
			<li><b>Rune</b> The use of Rune magic normally requires the caster to inscribe a symbol on a surface, whereupon the act of drawing channels the magic through the caster’s implement and binds it to the rune.</li>
			<li><b>Song</b> A tradition focused on sound in all its forms, much of its spells take the form of magical melodies that one can sing or play, enabling performers to produce magical effects through their performances.</li>
			<li><b>Soul</b> By calling upon the power of the soul, one can surpass the limits of the body and perform astonishing acts that any would deem impossible. However, any magic capable of harvesting energy from one’s soul can put that soul into peril—and the destruction of even a single soul diminishes the world in an irreparable way. </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Old Faith Magic</h3>
		<p>
			While Primordial magic was the first magic, it was given to humans. The magic of the Old Faith was devised by humans with Primordial as a base. Realizing the forces of the universe were no longer the six they were told, humans experimented, as is their wont.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Alchemy</b> Turn base metals into gold, restore life to the dead, and tease out the secrets of immortality.</li>
			<li><b>Nature</b> Nature spells call upon the earth and the plants. A close respect of the earth is required to make full use of these spells.</li>
			<li><b>Primal</b> Primal spells can call animals from nature and recruit them to service, or can impart bestial traits to their casters and those they touch, helping the recipients become fearless and more powerful.</li>
			<li><b>Spiritualism</b> The Spiritualism tradition finds its roots in the First People, who called forth the spirits of animals and of their ancestors to acquire their wisdom and their power.</li>
			<li><b>Storm</b> With ties to Air and Water magic, the Storm tradition grants control over the weather such that users of these spells can call down rain, loose bolts of lightning, and unleash the most brutal storms imaginable to scour the landscape.</li>
			<li><b>Transformation</b> The magic of the Transformation tradition enables casters to change not only their outward appearance but their very nature. Transformation spells can turn the caster into a different kind of creature—perhaps a mouse or a ferocious lion, an eagle or a steed, or any number of other physical forms.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Primordial Magic</h3>
		<p>
			The first and most chaotic magic, Primordial magic is pure control over the forces of the universe. This is magic in it's purest form.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Air</b> Students of Aeromancy learn to manipulate the air around them, assailing their foes with punishing blasts of wind or soaring to the clouds themselves.</li>
			<li><b>Chaos</b> Chaos magic works by releasing a burst of raw, magical energy and then using a loose framework to direct the energy into some useful or semi-useful effect. Although it can be unpredictable, Chaos magic’s appeal comes from how it can boost other magic and thus surpass what would normally be possible.</li>
			<li><b>Earth</b> It’s believed that this transformation is a consequence of learning the secret names of earth, stone, sand, and similar materials—names that, when spoken aloud, allow a caster to shape those substances and produce them from nothing. </li>
			<li><b>Fire</b> A tradition infamous for its ruinous power, Fire magic ignites flames and grants total mastery over their shape and form. Wherever users of Fire magic go, they leave ashes and cinders in their wake.</li>
			<li><b>Water</b> Spells of the Water tradition grant command and control over liquids and ice, allowing users to blast enemies with jagged shards of ice or entrap foes in giant, undulating orbs of water. Water magic also has restorative qualities for easing suffering and repairing injuries, though not to the same extent as the assistance offered by Life magic.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Royal Sorcery</h3>
		<p>
			The empire has its roots in the ancient cities on the mountains which used magic for every need. In the empire's height, it had State Wizards, expected to use their powers to create order. The following traditions are the techniques they devised.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Arcana</b> One of magic’s purest forms, the Arcana tradition offers reliable attacks, means for unraveling enemy spells, and a bevy of protective effects to help casters stay alive.</li>
			<li><b>Technomancy</b> Bridging the gap between magic and technology, Technomancy spells create all kinds of mechanical wonders by assembling devices from the scraps technomancers pick up along the way.</li>
			<li><b>Telekinesis</b> Telekinesis magic grants its user the ability to move and manipulate objects and creatures by thought alone. Whether crushing a foe in a mental grip or erecting an impassable barrier of telekinetic force, spells from this tradition allow the caster to create invisible force from the mind and use that force to change his or her environment.</li>
			<li><b>Telepathy</b> The mind’s potential has no limits. One must merely surmount the barriers of self-restraint, doubt, and fear in order to use one’s own thoughts to affect change in the world.</li>
			<li><b>Teleportation</b> Reality has numerous gaps, soft places that make possible instant transport from one place to another. Teleportation magic finds these openings and stretches them wide enough to allow casters and other people to move through them.</li>
			<li><b>Time</b> The ability to move through time and manipulate its passage lures many would-be masters to pit their minds against the complexities of the Time tradition, but most of them find themselves unable to free their intellects from the shackles of mundanity— which is required to truly apprehend reality from the perspective that this tradition demands.</li>
		</ul>
