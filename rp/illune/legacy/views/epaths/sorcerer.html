		<h1>SORCERER</h1>
		<img id="profile" src="../../content/paths/sorcerer.png" alt="Sorcerer">
		<p>
			The Kalasans brought sorcery to Ikseira in the days before the
Empire’s founding. Living weapons, these sorcerers spent
their life in hoods and chains until such time they were
needed to release their dread power. As instrumental as
they were in defeating the legions of Taelehar, sorcerers
were often as dangerous to their allies as they were to their
enemies. So with the end of Gog came the end of sorcerers,
the practice banned by imperial decree.
		</p>
		<p>
Sorcerers still walk the lands, however. Most discover
their talent for the dangerous tradition by accident, often
through some mishap or misfortune. A few, usually
renegades or heretics, make a deliberate effort to learn the
forbidden art of sorcery in order to wield its dread power.
		</p>
		<p>
Sorcery’s allure comes from the ability to seize even
greater amounts of magical energy than most other casters
to empower their spells. Spells amplified by sorcery are
harder to resist, deal more damage, have greater range,
and affect larger areas. However, each time sorcerers tap
into this energy, some remains trapped inside their bodies,
causing great strain as it tries to escape. If their control
slips, the pent-up energy explodes out from them in a
destructive wave capable of blowing people and objects
apart and leaving craters in the earth.
		</p>
		<p>
Given the technique’s destructive potential, sorcerers are
widely feared throughout the Empire, and stories often
surface of people finding burning craters and scorched
earth. The Cult of the New God and the Wizards of the
Tower Arcane sometimes join forces in uneasy alliance to
apprehend sorcery’s most egregious practitioners, though
such expeditions rarely end well for anyone.

		<h3>LEVEL 3 SORCERER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Attributes</b> Increase two by 1<br/>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2, Power +1<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> Make two choices. For each choice, you discover a tradition or learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Sorcery</b> You learn the secrets of sorcery. Whenever you cast an attack spell, you can use this talent to make your attack roll with 1 boon or to impose 1 bane on challenge rolls made to resist your attack.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each time you use this talent, you gain 1 strain, which represents your effort to contain the residual magical energy within your body. If you have any strain when you complete a rest, your strain total drops to 0.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Sorcerous Outburst</b> At the end of any round in which you gained 1 or more strain, you must make a Will challenge roll with a number of banes equal to your strain total. On a failure, magical energy explodes from a point within your reach into a sphere with a radius in yards equal to your strain total. The energy deals 1d6 damage per point of your Power to everything in the area other than you. A creature in the area that gets a success on an Agility challenge roll instead takes half the damage. Once you trigger your Sorcerous Outburst, your strain total drops to 0.
		</p>
		<h3>LEVEL 6 SORCERER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Greater Sorcery</b> Your understanding of Sorcery improves. Greater Sorcery replaces the Sorcery talent. When you cast a spell, you can choose to gain 1 strain and apply any one of the following effects to the spell.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Empowered Spell</b> If you cast an attack spell, this talent grants you 2 boons on your attack roll and imposes 2 banes on challenge rolls made to resist this spell.</li>
			<li><b>Enlarged Spell</b> If the spell affects an area, you double it. Thus, if the spell would affect a sphere with a 5-yard radius, you could affect a 10-yard radius instead.</li>
			<li><b>Far Spell</b> If the spell affects an area or a target other than you, you can increase the range from touch to short range, short range to medium range, medium to long, or long to extreme. Thus, if you would choose a point within short range, you can use this talent to choose a point within medium range instead.</li>
			<li><b>Lasting Spell</b> If the spell has a duration, you can use this talent to extend it. A duration of 1 minute becomes 10 minutes, 10 minutes becomes 1 hour, 1 hour becomes 8 hours, and 8 hours becomes 24 hours.</li>
			<li><b>Potent Spell</b> If you cast an attack spell that deals or heals damage, you can use this talent to increase the damage dealt or healed by the spell. If the spell deals damage or heals damage to one or more targets, each target takes or heals 2d6 extra damage. If the spell deals or heals damage over time, the spell instead deals or heals 1d6 extra damage.
		</ul>
		<h3>LEVEL 9 MASTER SORCERER</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Characteristics</b> Health +2, Power +1<br/>
			<b>Magic</b> You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Sorcerous Blast</b> You can release your strain as a blast of magical energy. You must have at least 1 strain to use this talent. Use an action to reduce your strain by 1 and make an Intellect or Will attack roll against the Agility of one creature or object within medium range. On a success, the blast of energy hits and the target takes 2d6 damage.
