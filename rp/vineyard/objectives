There is a disease on this planet, named Reapers.

Reapers turns humans into abominations. These abominations seek to kill and eat humans.
The disease is pervasive in the atmosphere. In order to be infected, the spores must penetrate your skin.
Reapers can only do this in the dark- they are vulnerable to light. They are
totally inactive during the day, and will avoid the light of the players' base.
Reapers is also vulnerable to smoke.

The abominations hunt in packs. They sleep at day and hunt at night.
They see heat and can endure light for short periods. They are vulnerable
to fire.
