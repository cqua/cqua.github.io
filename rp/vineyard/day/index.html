										<li>Each PC who was not downed the previous night reduces all harm and takes 1xp.</li>
										<li>Each PC suffers Exhausted (Level-1 Harm).</li>
										<li>Each PC who was downed must successfully Rest

									</ul>

									<b>Morning Tasks.</b> By Second Hour, PC's will have begun their daily endeavors.

								<li>
									<b>Afternoon Tasks.</b> Between Fourth and Fifth Hour, PC's move to afternoon tasks.

							<h1>The Map</h1>
							<p>
								The area surrounding the Base is divided into Zones- representing areas of a specific size, biome, or interest.
								Each zone has landmarks, representing structures or unique sites (the PCs' Base is always a landmark). Some tasks
								require the PC to choose a location. For these tasks, the PC may choose a zone or a landmark. Normally, a PC can perform tasks in zones adjacent to
								the zone containing the Base.
							</p>
						</div>
							<h1 id="task">Daytime Tasks</h1>
							<p>
								During the day, each PC is able to take two tasks- one during the morning, and one during the afternoon. It's in everyone's best interest to have returned by the evening.
								If multiple PCs perform the same task at the same time of day, they can choose to form a <a href="#team">team</a>.

								Choose a recipe from below or another recipe you've learned.
							</p>
							<p><b>The following recipes are Simple</b> - you may craft up to five in one task.
								<ul>
									<li>Filter Mask</li> Ignore the negative effects of being outside. +1 effect to Scavenge.
								</ul>

							<p><b>The following recipes are Complicated</b> - you must spend 1 Supply, roll on Acuity, then refer to the Complicated Crafting chart.

							</p>
							<h2 id="scavenge">Scavenge.</h2>
							<p>
								Choose an area. Roll on your best skill, then:
								<ul>
									<li><b>On a 4/5,</b> choose one:
										<ul>
											<li>You find supply, but you take a level-2 harm of the Referee's choice.</li>
											<li>You find supply with -1 effect.</li>
											<li>You lose any equipment used for the roll.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>On a 6,</b> you find supply.</li>
									<li><b>On a Critical Success,</b> choose one:
										<ul>
											<li>You gain supply, and a useful item of the Referee's choice.</li>
											<li>You gain supply with +1 effect.</li>
											<li>You gain supply and find a place to rest. Reduce one harm.</li>

									<li><b>3 Effect</b> 2d3 Supply.</li>
									<li><b>4+ Effect</b> 2d3 Supply and you find an item of your choice.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<h2 id="survey">Survey.</h2>
							<p>
								Choose an area made up of up to 5 zones. Then roll Sense, taking -1d for each zone in the area beyond the first:
								<ul>
									<li><b>On a 4/5,</b> choose one:
										<ul>
											<li>You map out the area, but you take a level-2 harm of the Referee's choice. Ask the Referee one question.</li>
											<li>You map out the area, but you lose any equipment used for the roll. Ask the Referee one question.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>On a 6,</b> map out the area.</li>
									<li><b>On a Critical Success,</b> choose one:
									<ul>
										<li>You map out the area, and a useful item of the Referee's choice.</li>
										<li>You map out the area and find 1d3 Supply.</li>
										<li>You map out the area and find a place to rest. Reduce one harm.</li>

							<h2 id="study">Study.</h2>
							<p>
								Nerd.

								Choose a zone. For the remainder of the day, you may perform any tasks as if your Base were in that zone.
							</p>
							<h2 id="rest">Rest (Limited to once per day).</h2>
							<p>
								Spend 1 Supply. You heal all Exhausted harm, then reduce all harm.
								<i>
									(All Level-1 harm is healed,
									all harm of a higher level is brought down one level)
								</i>.
								Then lose Momentum down to your Momentum Cap.

						<div>
						<h1>Downed PCs</h1>
						<p>
							A PC who has been downed must successfully rest before they can act during the day or night.
							Depending on where a player was downed, a Scavenge or Raid task may be required to return the downed PC to base.
						</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h1 id="team">Working as a Team</h1>
							<p>When two or more PCs take a task together, they can choose to act as a Team by choosing a Leader.</p>
							<p>Whenever the task calls for a roll, each member of the team attempts the roll.
								The result is the highest roll, but the Leader suffers Level-1 harm of the Referee's choice for each PC who rolled 1-3 as their best result.</p>
