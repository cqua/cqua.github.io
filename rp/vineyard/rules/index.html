						<h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>
							<p>Each character has five skills, a number between 0 and 5, which represents how adept they are at that skill:</p>
								<p><b>Grit (GR)</b> is a character's physical prowess.
									It measures strength, endurance, and resistance to physical ailments.
									Use Grit when wielding a heavy tool, running a long distance, intimidating an enemy, fighting off a poison.</p>
								<p><b>Finesse (FN)</b> is a character's physical fidelity.
									It measures flexibility, reaction speed, and ability to dodge.
									Use Finesse when using a fine tool, moving stealthily, telling a convincing lie, or avoiding a physical danger.</p>
								<p><b>Acuity (AC)</b> is a character's mental clarity.
									It measures logical reasoning, and ability to read emotions and intentions.
									Use Acuity when researching, scanning the horizon, or working with a machine.</p>
								<p><b>Sense (SN)</b> is a character's perception.
									It measures ability to percieve and quickly interpret the sights, sounds, and finer details of their environment.
									Use Sense when scanning the horizon, listening for footsteps, or reading body language.</p>
								<p><b>Forecast (FC)</b> is a character's psychokinesis.
									It measures ability to percieve and quickly interpret the sights, sounds, and finer details of their environment.
									Use Sense when scanning the horizon, listening for footsteps, or reading body language.</p>

						<h1 id="rolls">Skill Rolls</h1>
							<p>When you try to do an uncertain action, or when an ability calls for it, do a skill roll.</p>
							<p>Pick the appropriate skill. You start off with a number of d6 equal to that skill. Any relevant effect that gives you +d adds one more d6.
								If another character is helping you, you also get +d (does not apply to <a href="../day/#teams">team actions</a>).</p>
							<p>Then determine your effect level. Effect defaults to 0, and can be increased by equipment</p>
							<p>Roll the collected dice and look at the highest number rolled (if you would have zero or fewer dice, instead roll two and look at the lowest).</p>
							<p><b>On a 1-3, you Fumble.</b> You are at the mercy of the referee.</p>
							<p><b>A 4/5 is a Mixed Success.</b> You succeed with a consequence.</p>
							<p><b>A 6 is a Success.</b> You accomplish what you set out to do.</p>
							<p><b>If multiple dice rolled 6, thats a Critical Success.</b> You succeed beyond all expectation You gain 1 Momentum for every 6 rolled after the first.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
						<h1 id="effect">Effect Level</h1>
							<p>Where your Skills affect how likely any given action is to succeed, your effect level determines the magnitude of the action,
								and is largely determined by the equipment and tools used, as well as the environment and circumstances.</p>
								<table>
									<hr><td>Level</td><td>Effect</td></hr>
									<tr><td>0</td><td>Zero. Your achievements are negligable. A fist against stone.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>1</td><td>Limited. You achieve a partial or weak effect. A stone hammer against stone.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>2</td><td>Standard. You achieve what might be expected on an even playing field. A pickaxe against stone.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>3</td><td>Great. You achieve above usual. A heat laser against stone.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>4+</td><td>Extreme. You achieve beyond great. A nuclear warhead against stone.</td></tr>
								</table>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h1 id="harm">Harm</h1>
							<p>Harm is a consequence which represents a long-lasting debility. When you suffer harm,
								record the specific injury on your character sheet equal to the level of harm you suffer.</p>
							<p>While a row of harm is filled, you suffer the penalty indicated on the end of the row. While you have two
								Level-1 Harm, you have -1 effect. While you have two Level-2 harm, you hace -1d, and while you have a
								Level-3 Harm, you can't do anything without help from someone else or risking serious consequences.</p>
							<p>If you would mark a harm level, but the row is already filled, the harm moves up to the next available row.
								If the harm would exceed Level-3, you are downed, and suffer a <b>catastrophic, permanent consequence</b>.</p>
							<p>When you reduce a harm, move it to an available space on the previous level. If there is no space available,
								it is not reduced.</p>
							<p>When you intensify a harm, move it to an available space on the next level. If there is no space available,
								the harm moves up to the next available row.</p>
								<h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
								<p>If you have a type of armor that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to negate the harm or other consequence.</p>
								<p>Once an armor box is marked, it can't be used again until it's restored. <a>When does that happen???</a></p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h1 id="supply">Supply</h1>
							<p><b>Supply</b> is an abstract measure of food, fuel, and ammo; the large majority of this will be generic compounds to be
								fed into a printer. These compounds are portioned out to facilitate the most common uses. On a Core world, you might
								never see a container like this, as the stuff is piped directly into every block. But on the Rim, its hard to find something
								you can't buy for a "year's supply".
							</p>
							<p>
									1 Supply can be converted to a day's worth of food for one person, one liter of fuel, or one clip of ammo, using a basic
									printer. This can take up to 4 hours depending on complexity. Any more minor printer use is not tracked- any player with access to a printer is welcome to print themselves
									a fresh hot cup of earl grey every evening, cup and all, at no substantial cost.
