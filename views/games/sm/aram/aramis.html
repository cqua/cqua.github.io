			Situated on the Aramis Trace and giving its name to the region 
			as well as the subsector, is the world of Aramis, trade center and 
			subsector capital. The planet is some 9,500 kilometres in diameter, 
			swathed with a swirling corrosive fluorine atmosphere that makes life on its 
			dry desert surface intolerable. Nevertheless, the world boasts a 
			population of nearly 620,000, almost all contained within the tunnels 
			of its only city: Leedor. The city is the personal fief of the 
			<span class="dropdown">Marquis Leonard Naftas-Tyen of the House Shis'urna,<span class="dropdown-content">Proud Velani, 19th of his line</span></span>
			 and all important posts and contracts are let on the Marquis’ 
			sufferance and can be cancelled at his whim.
</p><p><span>The Deserts:</span> Few people live outside of the city of Leedor; 
those who do maintain weather monitoring stations or scientific data collectors, or 
rove about in ATVs prospecting for exploitable mineral deposits. 
</p><p><span>The City:</span> Leedor is underground, tunnelled into bedrock and often 
following the now empty veins from which ore has been extracted. The city’s population 
pursues many occupations: mining, local and subsector governmental bureaucracy, life 
support for the city, light manufacturing, working for the local shipyard and starport, 
and various jobs within the smut and naval bases. The city is a comfortable home and a reasonable provider for hundreds of thousands. 
</p><p><span>The Starport:</span> Aramis has a type A starport with an associated naval 
base, scout base, and shipyard (operated by the megacorporation Naasirka).
