			 A small world with a thin atmosphere and seas covering more than half its surface. Three major continents cover its southern hemisphere, while one major continent is in the northern hemisphere. Zila’s population is 66 million distributed mainly on the southern continents. The local government is a participatory democracy but with an extremely limited electorate. Suffrage is limited to land owners and even then only to those who hold 1,000 or more acres. In fact, a parcel of land consisting of 1,000 acres is seldom broken up once owned and is referred to commonly as a ballot. Families holding several ballots generally distribute them among the family members. Zila’s Law Level is high but is an accepted fact of life. The planet’s Tech Level is 7, lower than average but sufficient to make life comfortable. Zila is an agricultural world with a trading station to encourage exports to the Vargr.
