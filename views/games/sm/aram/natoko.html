			 A moderate-sized world along the Aramis Trace. Approximately 8,000 kilometres in diameter, it has a dense atmosphere and shallow seas covering 20% of its surface.
Natoko is relatively uninhabited; its population is less than a thousand, virtually all employees or dependents of the Naftas Company, which operates a starship overhaul service on the world. Local law level prohibits the grosser forms of violence but generally leaves behavior as a matter between individuals. Natoko’s technological capabilities are low, but the starport is capable of performing its routine tasks.
