			<p><span>Carsten</span> (C427402–B) is a lawless mining world whose major resource is radioactives. Ore is found in small pockets near the surface; large-scale mining is not economical but a population of individual prospectors can make a good living.</p>

			<p><span>L’oeil d’Dieu</span> (B98A510–B) is a water world under the aegis of Sharurshid, a megacorporation specialising in rare trade goods. Sharurshid obtains a variety of exotic seafood and other products from this world. There has been much pressure to have the world opened up for settlement but Sharurshid, fearing damage to the local ecosystem, has resisted.</p>

			<p><span>Reacher</span> (C9A8542–8) supports its economy by exporting simple organic compounds, 
			produced naturally in its exotic atmosphere and gathered more cheaply than they can be synthesised 
			elsewhere. The recent introduction of better synthesis technology into the subsector has reduced 
			Reacher’s market (Aramis and Patinir, once importers, now produce their own organics) and recent 
			incidents of violence against offworlders have led the <span class="dropdown">TAS<span class="dropdown-content">Travellers' Aid Society</span></span> to declare Reacher an amber zone. 
			
			<!--Rugbird is a world with an extremely insidious atmosphere. The system’s population lives in orbital habitats and the world’s considerable resources are exploited by remotely operated machines (heavily coated with resistant materials). Only repair crews, who receive hazard pay, venture down to the surface. Towers was once the seat of government for the Towers Cluster for the few years before the area was absorbed into the Imperium. Towers is an amber zone; its customs include a definite sense of honour and a strict duelling code to right slights and insults. Offworlders are warned to be cautious in their interaction with locals. Even visitors are expected to abide by the local code duello.<p>
			Corfu is interdicted by the Imperium as a quarantine measure. Approximately 40 years ago, a virulent, crippling disease appeared and has since come to affect 5% of the population. No cure for the disease is yet known, although some treatments have been found to relieve some of its effects. The Imperial Scout Service maintains a surveillance post in the system and is working to find a cure. In the interim, access to the world is prohibited.</p>

			Dhian is cursed with a very repressive government which maintains itself in power by virtue of its monopoly on the production of oxygen (as well as most food). All plants are grown hydroponically in government-owned farm complexes and the secrets of successful farming are jealously guarded. The government restricts technology to very low levels in order to safeguard its monopoly.

			Feneteman was unpopulated until a few years ago when a survey sponsored by Ling Standard Products discovered deposits of lanthanum. When the concentration was deemed insufficient for commercial mining, LSP released the survey report to the public and offered to rent prospecting equipment in return for an interest in any discoveries. The offer has been sufficient to maintain a small population of fortune-seekers on the world but without visible results.
Focaline is mostly ice-capped but a few broad open plains provide excellent ranges for groat-raising. The plains are crowded with family-owned ranches; indeed, the small usable surface of Focaline is somewhat overcrowded and strict population control is practised. A trading station for commerce with the Vargr is maintained on Focaline.
Heguz is a dangerously mysterious world in the Scatters. Two colonies have been established on this planet and each has failed for unexplained reasons. The first had 20,000 citizens in 649 but when a supply ship arrived in 650, no trace of the colony remained. Within a few years the colony was re-established, only to disappear in the early 900s with nearly 70,000 inhabitants. Both were formed around large, floating bases of the type often established on water worlds. Large areas of the ocean floor have been searched but so far no trace of either colony has been found. An investigative team representing another group of prospective colonists, numbering about 500 and based in orbit, is currently studying the world in an attempt to solve its mystery. 
Lablon is an agricultural world at the very edge of the subsector; its economy is supported mostly by the sale of agricultural produce to the Vargr through the local trading station. Most of the population of 500,000 lives in small farming towns scattered around the most fertile areas of the four continents. The government is called the Lablon Planetary Cartel; its main duty is ensuring that no community exports goods for anything other than the legally set prices; since the prices are high, there is little resistance. 
Lewis is an interdicted world holding an estate of the Tukera family and is described in the chapter entitled Inselberg.
Nasemin is a water world. A large, close moon, a high axial tilt and an energetic sun combine to produce giant tides and extreme weather effects. The world’s stormy seas are the home of a very large and nasty predator that is the source of an anti-inflammation drug, which has so far defied economical synthesis. Nasemin’s population is primarily occupied with chasing down these predators (called byssals) and excising the gland in which the drug is concentrated. Each yields about five kilograms of raw drug. The byssal (a 40,000 kilogram swimming carnivore/killer) regenerates the gland in about a year and can be harvested many times.
The byssal hunters operate in small crews aboard specially constructed submersibles. Much skill is involved in searching for the predator in the ocean depths; the actual capture process is short but dangerous.
Pavanne is an empty world with no population or current development. At one time, a mining company conducted extensive prospecting on the world but found no economically exploitable deposits. A landing beacon is still maintained by the mining company; it marks the main landing location on the world. Other than the beacon, all that remains are a few abandoned mining camps scattered about the world.
Paya is a small, nearly unpopulated world that is the subsector headquarters for Oberlindes Lines. It is described in the chapter entitled Exotic Encounters.
Pysadi is a religious dictatorship described in the chapter entitled Pysadian Escapade.

Violante is owned by a consortium of wealthy nobles from Deneb sector, whose ancestors, foreseeing a time when the spinward regions of the Imperium would be heavily populated, decided to invest in an unspoiled paradise. The world was parcelled into estates with strict controls on population and land use. The world population consists of landowners and their families (about 30% of whom live elsewhere for part of the year), supervisory staff, technicians and servants.
Yebab is the homeworld of a minor race known as Ebokin and is described in the chapter entitled Exotic Encounters.
Zila, an agricultural world famous for its wines, is described in the chapters entitled First Call at Zila and Zilan Wine.
Zykoca is an agricultural world under interdiction. Local society is extremely xenophobic and all contact offworld has been suspended. Foreigners are distrusted and have no standing in local society. The world was interdicted after a local mob broke into the starport, killing several offworlders.-->
