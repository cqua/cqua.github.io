		<p>A small world with a standard, tainted atmosphere and seas covering about 60% of the planetary surface. 
		The atmosphere, tainted due to the presence of gaseous components which cause giddiness, loss of coordination 
		and mental control, and eventual death in many offworld life forms, makes it necessary for humans and vesk to 
		wear filter masks (a common joke at the port is the recommendation that anyone who wants to get drunk should skip the bar, 
		go outside and take off his filter mask). The planet is frequently visited by starships in need of fuel, thanks to its convenient 
		location between Aramis and Aramanx; despite this frequency of contact, the world is properly considered 
		a part of the Scatters and is treated as a backwater.</p>
		
		<p>The central plain of Mere is small and relatively infertile, and has been allowed to remain grassland used 
		mostly for small herds of grazing stock. Pysadi’s farmland is found in the fertile mountain valleys, where a cool, 
		gentle climate and the runoff from the mountain heights combine to produce excellent conditions for agriculture. 
		Grains and fruits from Pysadi’s valley farms are grown for local consumption and contributed to the church, which 
		expects them. Pysadian produce is famed far and wide for taste and quality.</p>

		<p>The planet has a population of 1.9 million, most of which is clustered in the fertile valleys of the world’s major
		continent, Mere. These valleys are separated by mountain ranges, which serve as natural game preserves; most communities
		on the planet supplement food crops by hunting and trapping expeditions. The cities on Pysadi are primarily religious
		communities, serving as focal points for the public services operated by the all-encompassing Mother Church.</p>

		<p>The Mother Church is an authoritarian religious institution dedicated to the management and control of the entire world.
		This religious dictatorship vests power in the Epopt generally regarded as a figurehead-and an advisory council of priests
		who actually carry out the routine tasks of government. Society is tightly controlled but the people are generally contented 
		and unaware of the pervasive influence of their church government. A strict Law Level prohibits guns and frowns on
		weapons in general, greatly restricts freedom of movement and action, and absolutely forbids (due to religious strictures)
		the manufacture, sale or consumption of alcohol.</p>

		<p>Pysadi has a Tech Level of 4 and is generally an agrarian society. A farming world, Pysadi’s economy is centred 
		on agriculture in the fertile valleys of Mere, supplemented by stock raising, fishing and hunting. The church makes
		use of excess agricultural products to guard against future periods of famine and drought, or to sell offworld in exchange
		for imported goods. All church members are expected to voluntarily contribute such excesses and this is usually the case.
		The church has been known to extract these contributions by force when necessary.</p>

		<p>The planet has only one land-mass of continental size, plus a scattering of small islands. The continent, Mere,
		is the centre of population (more than 97% of the people live there). The world’s capital, and largest city,
		Sadi, is located on Mere’s east coast and is linked to the various farm communities of Mere by a network of rail lines.</p>
		<!--
		<p>Mere: Pysadi’s sole continent is a mountainous region dominated by a central plain. On the shores of the 
		calm waters of the Womb Sea, an almost landlocked body of water, the city of Sadi serves as the focal point 
		for the church, the government and the economy; it is also the location of the only starport on the world and 
		the hub of the Merespan railroad network.</p>
		
		<p>Communities: The continent is widely, if sparsely settled. In all, there are nine towns and about 40 settlements, plus the
		city of Sadi, on Pysadi. Most communities are located in the valleys, along the rail lines. Towns (averaging about 20,000 people,
		with an additional 20,000 or so in outlying farms) are situated at the ends of various rail lines and serve as granaries, church 
		centres and rail maintenance depots. Settlements are much smaller and consist of little more than a train station, a place of worship
		and a few other buildings needed to act as a focal point for the 3,000–5,000 people who live on farms within a 60 kilometre radius of
		the settlement proper and perhaps twice that many in isolated holdings at greater distances.</p>
		
		<p>Sadi: With a population of 200,000, Sadi is far and away the largest population centre on Pysadi. In addition to housing 
		the Epoptial Palace of the Mother Church, and with it the planet’s governmental centre, Sadi is the economic hub of Pysadi. 
		Trade through Pysadi Starport, the rail net and the Mother Bank – a church-affiliated institution which controls everything 
		from money supply to the ownership of commodity markets to the railroads – all are vital to Sadi’s role as the central pillar 
		of the planetary society.</p>
		
		<p>The city is divided into three districts, plus the starport (which, as an offworld enclave subject to the rules of extrality, 
		is completely independent from planetary control). The districts that comprise Sadi proper are described later.</p>
		
		<p>The Old Town is the original city, established as an interim settlement in the early stages of the planet’s colonisation. 
		Situated near the starport grounds, it consists of crowded blocks of buildings squeezed between large plazas and parks. 
		The plazas belong to the church; some contain church administration facilities, others hold the many imposing places of 
		worship that are found throughout Sadi, while a few are quiet, secluded, open areas given over to fountains and ponds, 
		trees, grass, and other aesthetically pleasing elements. Parks, on the other hand, are surrounded by massive brick walls 
		and are plainly marked as being off limits to any but church-authorised persons. Guards are posted at the securely barred 
		gates and questions about the parks elicit only the briefest replies, usually to the effect that these are areas where 
		religious instruction is carried out.</p>
		
		<p>The Business District lies beyond the Old Town, closer to the harbour and its many wharves. The main rail terminus 
		of Sadi is located at the heart of the business district, which is mostly composed of church-owned warehouses and granaries. 
		Produce from the country is offloaded from ships or trains, stored in these large facilities and dispersed back to the communities
		at need or transferred to the starport for shipment offworld.</p>
		
		<p>The Suburb is an enlargement of the city built to handle the gradual increase in population that has occurred over the year. 
		It consists of well-designed houses clustered around local churches and complexes of stores and administrative offices. The 
		suburb’s residents are primarily connected with the massive church bureaucracy. </p>
		
		<p>Architecture: Buildings intended for human habitation on Pysadi have been shaped by the special nature of the planet’s 
		ecology and culture. The atmospheric taint, which is dangerous due to its unsettling effect on the human brain, makes it 
		necessary that all buildings be sealed and equipped with filtering devices that screen out the dangerous components. Persons 
		inside these buildings are able to dispense with filter masks.</p>
		
		<p>On the other hand, the principles of Pysadian religion and culture encourage communication with nature. 
		Courtyards (sometimes open, sometimes enclosed by glass and filter conditioned) are common, as are large 
		expanses of windows designed to allow the best possible view. These elements combine to make Pysadian architecture 
		highly distinctive in nature.</p>
		
		<p>The Mother Church: The religious beliefs of the Pysadian populace are appropriate to their agrarian society. 
		The religion is a form of world worship, which treats Mother Pysadi as the giver of all things. Peace, cooperation 
		and communion with nature are stressed as ideals all people should strive for. The faith of the Mother Church runs
		strong and deep, from the lowliest farmer to the Epopt himself. Hypocrisy is not a characteristic of any facet of 
		the church, which undertakes its duties seriously and has by and large done a good job of handling its responsibilities. 
		Although rigid in its control over Pysadi, the church is perceived as beneficial and actually does act for the good of the 
		community.</p>
		
		<p>Of the Mother Church’s many unusual practices, the one best known among offworlders is ‘Communion with Mother Pysadi’,
		in which, with attendant ceremony to set the proper mood, a worshiper takes a few breaths of unfiltered air; short 
		exposure can bring about a state of religious euphoria; longer exposure can result in oracular visions of Mother Pysadi.</p>

		<p>The hierarchy of the Mother Church is headed by the Epopt, who rarely exercises more than nominal control over society. 
		Real power is vested in the next level, an advisory council of priests who control church and government activities. The 
		composition and number of this council varies but a core of five influential members, heading up the five major branches 
		of the government, are of most importance. The five branches include:</p>
		
		<p>• The Distributary, which runs shops and distribution media. </p>
		<p>• The Productionary, concerned with agricultural production. </p>
		<p>• The Propagatory, which handles education, particularly religious education. </p>
		<p>• The Offeratory, concerned with the collection of offerings (i.e. taxes), generally collected in kind (grain or meat, sometimes labour). </p>
		<p>• The Salvors, who act as the enforcement arm of the church.</p>
Many aspects of the church are, to some degree, secret or at least not widely known off Pysadi. Inner rituals of the church and priesthood, the details of the planetary economy and the actual political hierarchy within the advisory council are among those things which are not generally known or discussed by the average citizen, particularly with offworlders.
Railroads: The MereSpan RailLine is the major transport system on Pysadi. Emanating like spokes from the city of Sadi, rail lines connect the city to the various outlying communities. Along most lines, the railroad is a single track; low priority trains are shunted onto sidings to allow those with a higher priority to pass in either direction.
The railroads are operated and maintained by the ‘Rail Corps’, a hereditary group (augmented as needed with new recruits) descended from the original rail construction workers who established the railroads in the early days of settlement on Pysadi. 
49
The Corps is responsible, under the auspices of the Productionary, for maintaining and repairing every kilometre of track, and for the operation and maintenance of the trains themselves.
The most common type of train carries both cargo and passengers, and runs once per week on each spoke. Trains can achieve speeds of 110 kilometres per hour and generally take six days to make the round trip out from Sadi and back. The trains do not run on Senday; a train will remain in whatever settlement it happens to stop in for an entire day in such cases. These stops are welcomed by the settlement so favoured, as they bring visitors and news that would otherwise pass on without stopping for more than the briefest of halts.
Referee’s Note: Although trains theoretically have a schedule, these are so frequently disrupted as to be random. Throw 1d6 to determine the number of days before a train is due to leave Sadi. It spends three days travelling to the end of the line and three days on the return journey. If Senday falls at any point of the trip, the train does not move that day. On each trip, there will be a 50 percent chance of a one-day delay (due to rail repairs or a higher-priority train). Train passage costs Cr. 12 per hex one way, or Cr. 20 per hex round trip. 
Other Transport: While railroads are ubiquitous, Pysadi is much less progressive where other forms of transportation are concerned. Roads are primitive at best and vehicles more advanced than carts or wagons are rare. ATYs, groundcars and similar equipment are considered an offence to Mother Pysadi, due to the damage they cause to ground cover and other factors. They may be used around the city/starport complex in relative freedom but use outside the city is definitely out of the question.
Most other forms of transportation are regulated by the church’s tight control over movement. Permits are required to operate any starship, ship’s boat, grav vehicle or aircraft anywhere on the planet, except for approaches to and from the starport. The reasons for this have never been made clear but violation of these restrictions can result in heavy fines and/or confiscation. It should be noted, however, that Pysadi has little detection apparatus and no local naval forces, so their ability to enforce these restrictions is limited. Nonetheless the visitor who flouts authority in this fashion can expect an unpleasant welcome if he is foolish enough to return. 
Sea lanes: Some sea transport exists on Pysadi, primarily along the coast. Heavy bulk cargos are often shipped by sea in large ocean-going barges. Barges average 10 kilometres per hour and generally lay up on religious days in observance of the prohibition on work. Generally, barges do not carry passengers but a captain can sometimes be persuaded to carry a group for a small fee (perhaps Cr. 100 each).
The Map: The map of Pysadi (overleaf) shows the world using a geodesic map grid dividing the world into hexagons and triangles. If cut out and folded, the map would create an icosahedrons (a 20 sided polygon) which approaches a globe in shape.
Each hexagon measures approximately 575 kilometres across and can be used to judge scale and distance. Within each hexagon are one or more terrain types, showing the nature of the area.
The players and Referee can use the information on the map to determine the time and distance required for various journeys. The terrain key indicates the types of terrain and shows the movement rates expected for the terrain type and means of transportation being used. For example, the clear terrain movement rate for individuals is 220 hours per hex (on foot).
The rate takes rest into account, assuming that walking takes up half the time (11 hours per day) and that characters rest for the remaining 11 hours. The resulting speed is about 5.5 kilometres per hour, reflecting a lack of roads or paths on Pysadi; crossing a clear hex takes 10 days. Rail and boat movement rates do not assume any need to rest.
If no movement rate is listed next to a terrain symbol, use the movement rate listed for other terrain types in the hex.
Time: The local day is 22 hours long about 11 hours of day and 11 hours of night. The week of seven days is ended by a day of rest (Senday) on which no business is transacted. Throw 1d6+1 for the current day of the week when the March Harrier arrives on Pysadi; if it is Senday, even the starport will be closed to traffic in deference to local sensibilities and the ship will have to remain in orbit an extra day.
