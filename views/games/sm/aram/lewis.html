		<p>
		A small world with a diameter of approximately 6,400 kilometres, a very thin, tainted atmosphere and large oceans 
		covering three-quarters of the surface of the planet. A young world, Lewis is one of several satellites of the only 
		gas giant in the system. The world has a population of just over 73,000 persons, mostly farmers. There is no 
		government established on the world; among the farming community family ties predominate – a system which 
		has worked very well for several generations. A D-class starport facility exists on the world (as well a
		s several smaller landing fields of even lower quality); this is controlled by the Tukera family and reserved for their use.</p>
		
		<p>Lewis was, indeed, entirely owned by the Tukeras for quite some time but, about 150 years ago, 
		a Tukera baron in need of funds was forced to sell off some of the family lands to outside settlers. 
		This community flourished for quite some time; recently, the family has been attempting to recover those 
		lands and the ownership of the world. After several unsuccessful efforts to force the independent settlers 
		to sell out, Tukera interests at Court (with the support of Marquis of Aramis) have managed to have the planet interdicted.</p>
		
		<p>A special access dispensation allows family members to come and go as they please but all 
		trade and outside contact has been cut off, isolating the settlers. So far they have shown 
		an amazing degree of self-sufficiency but the Tukera family still believes that the increasing 
		hardships of this isolation will eventually compel them to give up and sell their land.</p>
		
		<p>The Tukera estates at Inselberg on Lewis are isolated from the main areas of settlement, 
		surrounded by desert and protected from intrusions by an excellent security organisation.</p>
		
		<p>The nearest town is some 100 kilometres away. Inselberg’s facilities enjoy a Tech Level of 13; the settlers are limited to a much lower level of technology.
