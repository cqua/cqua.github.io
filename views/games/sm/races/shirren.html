		<h1>Shirren</h1>
		<p>
			Shirrens were once a monstrous swarm. Centuries ago, however, 
			a mysterious mutation caused an entire subcolony to break 
			from the hivemind, with each of its members gaining a sense 
			of self. In addition to their two sets of main limbs, they 
			also have two sets of smaller limbs growing from their 
			thoraxes. While often displayed, these “mating arms” are 
			extremely weak and used only for ceremonial and reproductive 
			purposes—to use them for mundane 
			activities would be seen as grotesque and shameful.
